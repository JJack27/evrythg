Segway Human Transporter
www.segway.com
20 /50
The Segway™ Human Transporter (HT) is the first
self-balancing, electric-powered transportation device.
With dimensions no larger than the average adult body
and the ability to emulate human balance, the Segway
HT uses the same space as a pedestrian, and can go
wherever a person can walk.
Dynamic stabilization is the essence of the Segway
Human Transporter (HT). Dynamic stabilization
enables Segway HT to work seamlessly with the body’s
movements.
Gyroscopes and tilt sensors in Segway HT monitor a user’s center of
gravity at about 100 times a second. When a person leans slightly
forward, Segway HT moves forward. When leaning back, Segway HT
moves back.

Short historical notes
Water level controllers date back to ancient Greece
(Ktesibios of Alexandria, water clock, 270 B.C.), (Philon of Byzantium, 250 B.C.)
(Heron of Alexandria, ≈100 A.D.)
Other examples in the 17th-18th century
(Cornelis Drebbel’s incubator, 1620), (Edmund Lee’s self-regulating wind machine, 1745)
(Thomas Mead’s lift tenter and speed controller, 1787)
James Watt’s ﬂyball governor (1788)
Used to regulate the speed of steam engines.
If speed increases, flyballs spread apart and
the steam flow through the throttle is reduced.
And vice versa.
Frequency domain (1930-1950)
(H. Nyquist, H.W. Bode, N.B. Nichols)
State-space and optimal control (1950-1980)
(R. Kalman, R. Bellman)
Nonlinear, robust, adaptive, optimization-based, (…) control (1980-today)

Is control needed after all ?
Friday November 7, 1997
Baby Benz falls foul of a moose
“Mercedes is recalling 3,000 brand-new
A Class mini cars to correct stability
problems revealed in Scandinavian
tests.”
A Class failed the “moose test”, simulating a sudden swerve
to avoid a moose on the road.
The recall of about 3,000 cars followed motoring press
reports which indicated the A Class is unstable, and likely
to roll over, in extreme lane-changing tests.
Problem solved by introducing the Electronic Stability
Program (ESP), which automatically manipulates brakes
(and engine torque) to keep skid under control.

Process control
Control is heavily used in the process industries
wi ! j
the controller does its best to track rj, sacrificing ri tracking if
necessary. If w j = 0 , on the other hand, the controller completely ignores
deviations rj–yj.
Usually slow processes (heat transfer, chemical reactions, distillation, etc.)
Choosing the weights is a critical step. You will usually need to tune your
controller, varying the weights to achieve the desired behavior.
Usually several input and output variables
As an example, consider Figure 1-3, which depicts a type of chemical reactor (a
CSTR). Feed enters continuously with reactant concentration CAi. A reaction
takes place inside the vessel at temperature T. Product exits continuously, and
contains residual reactant at concentration CA (<CAi).
The reaction liberates heat. A coolant having temperature Tc flows through
Example: Continuous stirred-tank reactor
coils immersed in the reactor to remove excess heat.
Figure 1-3: CSTR Schematic
Manipulated inputs:
reactant concentration CAi in feed
From the Model Predictive Control Toolbox point for view, T and CA would be
coolant CAi and Tc would
plant outputs, and temperature Tcbe inputs. More specifically, CAi would be
an independent disturbance input, and Tc would be a manipulated variable
(actuator).
Controlled outputs:
There is one manipulated variable (the coolant temperature), so it’s impossible
reactant concentration CAi in vessel
to hold both T and CA at setpoints. Controlling T would usually be a high
vessel temperature T
priority. Thus, you might set the output weight for T much larger than that for
CA. In fact, you might set the CA weight to zero, allowing CA to float within an

Open-loop vs. closed-loop control
Closed-loop control (feedback control)
Measurements of the output variables are fed back to the process through the controller
Open-loop control (feedforward control)
The manipulated input variable is generated without measuring the output variable
41 /50
Control systems design
How to design a (modern) control system
Understand the automation problem:
Which variables can be manipulated by actuators ?
What are the output variables of interest ?
What should we measure ?
Which are the disturbances ?
Get a reliable simulation model
Get a simplified mathematical model of the main process dynamics
Use design techniques to synthesize the control algorithm
Test in simulation, validate on real process
Control design requires a dynamical model of the open-loop process
