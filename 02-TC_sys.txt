Dynamical systems

Dynamical models

A dynamical system is an object (or a set of objects) that evolves over time,
possibly under external excitations.
Examples: a car, a robotic arm, a population of animals, an electrical circuit,
a portfolio of investments, etc.
The way the system evolves is called the dynamics of the system.
A dynamical model of a system is a set of mathematical laws explaining in a
compact form and in quantitative way how the system evolves over time,
usually under the effect of external excitations.
Main questions about a dynamical system:

Understanding the system (“How X and Y inﬂuence each other ?”)
Simulation (“What happens if I apply action Z on the system ?”)
Design (“How to make the system behave the way I want ?”)

Dynamical models

Qualitative models only useful in non-technical domains
(examples: politics, advertisement, psychology,...)
Experiments provide an answer, but have limitations:
1
2
3

maybe too expensive (example: launch a space shuttle)
maybe too dangerous (example: a nuclear plant)
maybe impossible (the system doesn’t exist yet!)

In contrast, mathematical models allows us to:
1

2
3

capture the main phenomena that take place in the system
(example: Newton’s law – a force on a mass produces an acceleration)
analyze the system (relations among dynamical variables)
simulate the system (=make predictions) about how the system behaves under
certain conditions and excitations (in analytical form, or on a computer)

Dynamical models
Working on a model has almost zero cost compared to real experiments (just
mathematical thinking, paper writing, computer coding)
However, a simulation (or any other inference obtained from the model) is as
better as the dynamical model is closer to the real system
Conﬂicting objectives:
1

Descriptive enough to capture the main behavior of the system

2

Simple enough for analyzing the system

“Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler.”

State vector
Generally speaking, the state of a dynamical system is a set of variables that
completely summarizes the past history of the system, and allows us to
predict its future motion
For the linear system
˙(t)
x
y(t)

=
=

Ax(t) + Bu(t)
Cx(t) + Du(t)

given the initial state x(0) and the input signal u(t), ∀t ∈ [0, T], we already know how to compute the state x(t) and the output y(t) of the system,
If we know the initial state x(0), we can neglect the past history
The dimension n of the state $x(t)$ $n$ is called the order of the system

Stability of continuous-time linear systems
Since the natural response of ˙ = Ax + Bu is x(t) = eAt x0 , the stability properties
x
depend only on A. We can therefore talk about system stability of a linear system
(A, B, C, D)
Theorem:
Let λ1 , . . ., λm , m ≤ n be the eigenvalues of A ∈
[ $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ ]
. The system ˙ = Ax + Bu is
x

asymptotically stable iff ℜλi < 0, ∀i = 1, . . . , m
(marginally) stable if ℜλi ≤ 0, ∀i = 1, . . . , m, and the eigenvalues with null real part have equal algebraic and geometric multiplicity
unstable if ∃ i such that ℜλi > 0
Algebraic multiplicity of λi = number of coincident roots λi of det(λI − A). 
Geometric multiplicity of λi = number of linearly independent eigenvectors vi , Avi = λi vi

The stability properties of a linear system only depend on the real part of the eigenvalues of matrix A

The natural response is x(t) = eAt x0 (eAt
If matrix A is diagonalizable , A = TΛT

Take any eigenvalue λ = a + jb:
|eλt | = eat |ejbt | = eat

A is always diagonalizable if algebraic multiplicity = geometric multiplicity

If A is not diagonalizable, it can be transformed to Jordan form. In this case the natural

Let (xr , ur ) be an equilibrium, f (xr , ur ) = 0
Objective: investigate the dynamic behaviour of the system for small
perturbations ∆u(t) u(t) − ur and ∆x(0) x(0) − xr .
The evolution of ∆x(t)

x(t) − xr is given by

Linearization

Lyapunov’s indirect method
Consider the nonlinear system ˙ = f (x), with f differentiable, and assume
x
x = 0 is equilibrium point (f (0) = 0)
Consider the linearized system ˙ = Ax, with A =
x

∂f
∂ x x=0

If ˙ = Ax is asymptotically stable, then the origin x = 0 is also an
x
asymptotically stable equilibrium for the nonlinear system (locally)
If ˙ = Ax is unstable, then the origin x = 0 is an unstable equilibrium for the
x
nonlinear system
If A is marginally stable, nothing can be said about the stability of the origin
x = 0 for the nonlinear system
