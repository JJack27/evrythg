Dynamical models
A dynamical system is an object (or a set of objects) that evolves over time,
possibly under external excitations.
Examples: a car, a robotic arm, a population of animals, an electrical circuit,
a portfolio of investments, etc.
The way the system evolves is called the dynamics of the system.
A dynamical model of a system is a set of mathematical laws explaining in a
compact form and in quantitative way how the system evolves over time,
usually under the effect of external excitations.
Main questions about a dynamical system:
Understanding the system (“How X and Y inﬂuence each other ?”)
Simulation (“What happens if I apply action Z on the system ?”)
Design (“How to make the system behave the way I want ?”)

Dynamical models
Qualitative models only useful in non-technical domains
(examples: politics, advertisement, psychology,...)
Experiments provide an answer, but have limitations:
maybe too expensive (example: launch a space shuttle)
maybe too dangerous (example: a nuclear plant)
maybe impossible (the system doesn’t exist yet!)
In contrast, mathematical models allows us to:
capture the main phenomena that take place in the system
(example: Newton’s law – a force on a mass produces an acceleration)
analyze the system (relations among dynamical variables)
simulate the system (=make predictions) about how the system behaves under
certain conditions and excitations (in analytical form, or on a computer)

Dynamical models
Working on a model has almost zero cost compared to real experiments (just
mathematical thinking, paper writing, computer coding)
However, a simulation (or any other inference obtained from the model) is as
better as the dynamical model is closer to the real system
Conﬂicting objectives:
Descriptive enough to capture the main behavior of the system
Simple enough for analyzing the system
“Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler.”

Linear systems
State vector
Generally speaking, the state of a dynamical system is a set of variables that
completely summarizes the past history of the system, and allows us to
predict its future motion
For the linear system
˙(t)
y(t)
Ax(t) + Bu(t)
Cx(t) + Du(t)
given the initial state x(0) and the input signal u(t), ∀t  [0, T], we already know how to compute the state x(t) and the output y(t) of the system,
If we know the initial state x(0), we can neglect the past history
The dimension n of the state $x(t)$ $n$ is called the order of the system

Some classes of dynamical systems
Causality: a dynamical system is causal if y(t) does not depend on future
inputs u(τ) ∀τ > t (strictly causal if ∀τ ≥ t)
A linear system is always causal, and strictly causal iff D = 0
Linear time-varying (LTV) systems:
˙(t)
y(t)
A(t)x(t) + B(t)u(t)
C(t)x(t) + D(t)u(t)
When A, B, C, D are constant, the system is said linear time-invariant (LTI)
Multivariable systems: more generally, a system can have m inputs
(u(t)  m ) and p outputs (y(t)  p ). For linear systems, we still have

Definition
A state $x_r$  n and an input $u_r$ m are an equilibrium pair if for initial condition x(0) = xr and constant input u(t) ≡ ur the state remains constant: x(t) ≡ xr , ∀t ≥ 0
Equivalent deﬁnition: (xr , ur ) is an equilibrium pair if f (xr , ur ) = 0
$x_r$ is called equilibrium state, $u_r$ equilibrium input
The deﬁnition generalizes to time-varying nonlinear systems

Stability
Consider the nonlinear system
and let xr an equilibrium state, f (xr , ur ) = 0
Definition
The equilibrium state xr is stable if for each initial conditions x(0) “close
enough” to xr , the corresponding trajectory x(t) remains near xr for all t ≥ 0 a
Analytic deﬁnition: ∀ε > 0 ∃δ > 0 : x(0) − xr < δ ⇒ x(t) − xr < ε, ∀t ≥ 0
The equilibrium point xr is called asymptotically stable if it is stable and
x(t) → xr for t → ∞
Otherwise, the equilibrium point xr is called unstable

Since the natural response of ˙ = Ax + Bu is x(t) = eAt x0 , the stability properties
depend only on A. We can therefore talk about system stability of a linear system
(A, B, C, D)
Theorem:
Let $\lambda$, m ≤ n be the eigenvalues of A 
[ $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ ]
. The system ˙ = Ax + Bu is asymptotically stable iff ℜλi < 0, ∀i = 1, . . . , m
(marginally) stable if ℜλi ≤ 0, ∀i = 1, . . . , m, and the eigenvalues with null real part have equal algebraic and geometric multiplicity
unstable if ∃ i such that ℜλi > 0
Algebraic multiplicity of λi = number of coincident roots λi of det(λI − A). 
Geometric multiplicity of λi = number of linearly independent eigenvectors vi , Avi = λi vi
The stability properties of a linear system only depend on the real part of the eigenvalues of matrix A

If matrix A is diagonalizable , A = TΛT

State vector
Generally speaking, the state of a dynamical system is a set of variables that
completely summarizes the past history of the system, and allows us to
predict its future motion
For the linear system
˙(t)
y(t)
Ax(t) + Bu(t)
Cx(t) + Du(t)
given the initial state x(0) and the input signal u(t), ∀t  [0, T], we already know how to compute the state x(t) and the output y(t) of the system,
If we know the initial state x(0), we can neglect the past history
The dimension n of the state $x(t)$ $n$ is called the order of the system

Some classes of dynamical systems
Causality: a dynamical system is causal if y(t) does not depend on future
inputs u(τ) ∀τ > t (strictly causal if ∀τ ≥ t)
A linear system is always causal, and strictly causal iff D = 0
Linear time-varying (LTV) systems:
˙(t)
y(t)
A(t)x(t) + B(t)u(t)
C(t)x(t) + D(t)u(t)
When A, B, C, D are constant, the system is said linear time-invariant (LTI)
Multivariable systems: more generally, a system can have m inputs
(u(t)  m ) and p outputs (y(t)  p ). For linear systems, we still have

Definition
A state $x_r$  n and an input $u_r$ m are an equilibrium pair if for initial condition x(0) = xr and constant input u(t) ≡ ur the state remains constant: x(t) ≡ xr , ∀t ≥ 0
Equivalent deﬁnition: (xr , ur ) is an equilibrium pair if f (xr , ur ) = 0
$x_r$ is called equilibrium state, $u_r$ equilibrium input
The deﬁnition generalizes to time-varying nonlinear systems
Lecture: Continuous-time linear systems
Stability
Consider the nonlinear system
and let xr an equilibrium state, f (xr , ur ) = 0
Definition
The equilibrium state xr is stable if for each initial conditions x(0) “close
enough” to xr , the corresponding trajectory x(t) remains near xr for all t ≥ 0 a
Analytic deﬁnition: ∀ε > 0 ∃δ > 0 : x(0) − xr < δ ⇒ x(t) − xr < ε, ∀t ≥ 0
The equilibrium point xr is called asymptotically stable if it is stable and
x(t) → xr for t → ∞
Otherwise, the equilibrium point xr is called unstable

Stability of continuous-time linear systems
Since the natural response of ˙ = Ax + Bu is x(t) = eAt x0 , the stability properties
depend only on A. We can therefore talk about system stability of a linear system
(A, B, C, D)
Theorem:
Let λ1 , . . ., λm , m ≤ n be the eigenvalues of A 
[ $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ ]
. The system ˙ = Ax + Bu is
asymptotically stable iff ℜλi < 0, ∀i = 1, . . . , m
(marginally) stable if ℜλi ≤ 0, ∀i = 1, . . . , m, and the eigenvalues with null real part have equal algebraic and geometric multiplicity
unstable if ∃ i such that ℜλi > 0
Algebraic multiplicity of λi = number of coincident roots λi of det(λI − A). 
Geometric multiplicity of λi = number of linearly independent eigenvectors vi , Avi = λi vi

The natural response is x(t) = eAt x0 (eAt
If matrix A is diagonalizable , A = TΛT
Take any eigenvalue λ = a + jb:
|eλt | = eat |ejbt | = eat
A is always diagonalizable if algebraic multiplicity = geometric multiplicity
If A is not diagonalizable, it can be transformed to Jordan form. In this case the natural
response x(t) contains modes tj eλt , j = 0, 1, . . . , alg. multiplicity - geom. multiplicity
