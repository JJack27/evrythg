Task 1 (1.2 pts.) Suppose the target is 1.0 for six steps, then 0 for six steps, and then alternates between 1.0 and 0 for six more steps, as shown by the grey line in the graph below. Suppose the initial estimate is 0, and that the step-size (in the equation) is 0.5. Your job is to apply Equation 2.4 iteratively to determine the estimates for time steps 1-18. Plot them on the graph below, using
a blue pen, connecting the estimate points by a blue line. The first two estimate points are already marked and connected in dark blue (or black) below:
