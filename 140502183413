Independence, Uncorrelatedness and Orthogonality
If $\sigma_{xy} = 0$, then X and Y are uncorrelated and
X and Y called orthogonal if E {XY } = 0.
If X and Y are independent then they are uncorrelated.
Uncorrelatedness does not imply the independence. For example, if X is a normal RV with zero mean and Y = X 2 we have p(y |x) = p(y ) The correlation only shows the linear dependence between two RV so [ it is ] is weaker than independence.
For Jointly Gaussian RVs, independence is equivalent to being uncorrelated.
