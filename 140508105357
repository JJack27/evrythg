Deﬁnition 2.1 (Hilbert space). A finite dimensional vector space H over K (which is either R or C) endowed with an inner product that fulﬁlls
$\langle x, y\rangle = \overline{\langle y, x \rangle}$ (conjugate symmetry)
(linearity in the ﬁrst argument)
x, x > 0 for all x = 0
(10)
(positive deﬁniteness)
for all x, y, z ∈ H is called a ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space.
