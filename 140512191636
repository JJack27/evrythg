Continuous functions of two variables satisfy all of the usual properties familiar from single variable calculus:
* The sum of a finite number of continuous functions is a continuous function.
* The product of a finite number of continuous functions is a continuous function.
* The quotient of two continuous functions is a continuous function wherever the denominator is non-zero.
