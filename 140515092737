This is the celebrated MIT rule. The partial derivative $\frac{\partial \e}{\partial \theta}$ which is called the sensitivity derivative of the system, tells how the error is influenced by the adjustable parameter. If it is assumed that the parameter changes are slower than the other variables in the system, then the derivative $\frac{\partial e}{\partial{\theta} can be evaluated under the assumption that $\theta$ is constant.
