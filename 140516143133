If the environment’s dynamics are completely known, then (4.4) is a system of |S| simultaneous linear equations in |S| unknowns (the vπ (s), s ∈ S). In principle, its solution is a straightforward, if tedious, computation. For our purposes, iterative solution methods are most suitable. Consider a sequence of approximate value functions v0 , v1 , v2 , . . ., each mapping S+ to R.  The initial approximation, v0 , is chosen arbitrarily (except that the terminal state, if any, must be given value 0), and each successive approximation is obtained by using the Bellman equation for vπ (3.10) as an update rule:
_v('140507090509')
$v_{k+1} = \ldots$ (4.5)
for all s ∈ S. Clearly, vk = vπ is a ﬁxed point for this update rule because the Bellman equation for vπ assures us of equality in this case. Indeed, the sequence {vk } can be shown in general to converge to vπ as k → ∞ under the same conditions that guarantee the existence of vπ . This algorithm is called iterative policy evaluation.
