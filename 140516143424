_v('140514094507')
This algorithm is called value iteration. It can be written as a particularly simple backup operation that combines the
policy improvement and truncated policy evaluation steps:
$v_{k+1} = \ldots$ (4.10)
For arbitrary v0 , the sequence {vk } can be shown to converge to v∗ under the same conditions that guarantee the existence of v∗ .
