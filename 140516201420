Markov Reward Process
A Markov reward process is a Markov chain with values.
Deﬁnition
A Markov Reward Process is a tuple S, P, R, γ
S is a ﬁnite set of states
P is a state transition probability matrix, Pss = P [s | s]
R is a reward function, $R_s = E[r | s]$
$\gamma$ is a discount factor, $\gamma \in [0, 1]$
