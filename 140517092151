Standard form LP
Consider an LP in standard form,

subject to
which has inequality constraint functions fi (x) = −xi , i = 1, . . . , n. To form
the Lagrangian we introduce multipliers λi for the n inequality constraints and
multipliers νi for the equality constraints, and obtain
L(x, λ, ν) = c x −
λi xi + ν T (Ax − b) = −bT ν + (c + AT ν − λ)T x.
The dual function is
g(λ, ν) = inf L(x, λ, ν) = −bT ν + inf (c + AT ν − λ)T x,
