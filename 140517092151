Standard form LP [ linear program ]
Consider an LP in standard form,
(5.6)
subject to
which has inequality constraint functions fi (x) = −xi , i = 1, . . . , n. To form the Lagrangian we introduce multipliers λi for the n inequality constraints and multipliers νi for the equality constraints, and obtain


The dual function is
