Fisherâ€™s Information Inequality
An universal lower bound for the variance of an estimator can be introduced, if the following [ regularity ] conditions are
fullfilled:
[ _v('140510091627') ] [ (4.1) - (4.3) ]
Definition. Consequently, we define the Score Function as
$\operatorname{g}(x; \theta) = \ldots$
[ _v('140509215904') ] (4.4)
[ _cf('140515214623') ]
