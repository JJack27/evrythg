The state trajectory is the natural response
_v('140504233114')
where $v_i$ =eigenvector of A, $\lambda_i$ eigenvalue of A, $\alpha = $
The evolution of the system depends on the eigenvalues λi of A, called modes of the system (sometimes we also refer to eλi t as the i-th mode)
A mode λi is called excited if αi = 0
