_v('140504215652')
One can verify by inspection that the given nth -order ODE is equivalent to the following 1st -order linear system of ODEs:
The operation of transforming a nth -order ODE into a linear system of 1st -order ODEs is called state-space realization. There are inÔ¨Ånitely many realizations.
