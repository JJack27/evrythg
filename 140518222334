Other state-space realization methods
The following state-space realization is called controllable canonical form
_v('140504220319')
−a0 −a1 −a2 ... −an−1
The following state-space realization is called observable canonical form 2
 −an−2 0 1 ... 0 0 
 −a
−a1
−a0
We will see later in the course that the pair (A, B) is completely reachable.
We will see later in the course that the pair (A, B) is completely observable.
