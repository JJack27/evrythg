Linear ordinary differential equations
nth -order linear  ODE with input
[ _v('140504215652') ]
[ by setting [ _v('140518223843') ] ]
One can verify by inspection that the given nth -order ODE is equivalent to the following 1st -order linear system of ODEs:
[ _v('140518223618') ]
The operation of transforming a nth -order ODE into a linear system of 1st -order ODEs is called state-space realization. There are inÔ¨Ånitely many realizations.
