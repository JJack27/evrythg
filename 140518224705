Poles and Zeros
Rewrite the transfer function as the ratio of polynomials (m < n)
[ _v('140518224801') ]
The roots pi of D(s) are called the poles of the linear system G(s)
The roots zi of N(s) are called the zeros of G(s)
G(s) is often written in zero/pole/gain form
[ _v('140518224739') ]
In MATLAB use ZPK to transform to zero/pole/gain form
