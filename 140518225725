Steady-state solution and DC gain
Let A asymptotically stable. Natural response vanishes asymptotically
Assume constant u(t) ≡ ur . What is the asymptotic value xr = limt→∞ x(t) ?
Impose 0 = ˙r (t) = Axr + Bur and get xr = −A−1 Bur
The corresponding steady-state output yr = Cxr + Dur is
[ _v('140518225746') ]
DC gain
Cf. final value theorem:
[ u_r is constant $\iff$ U(s) = \frac{u_r}{s} ] 
G(0) is called the DC gain of the system
