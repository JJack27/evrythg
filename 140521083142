Affine sets
A set C ⊆ Rn is affine if the line through any two distinct points in C lies in C, i.e., if for any x1 , x2 ∈ C and θ ∈ R, we have θx1 + (1 − θ)x2 ∈ C. In other words, C contains the linear combination of any two points in C, provided the coefficients in the linear combination sum to one.  This idea can be generalized to more than two points. We refer to a point of the form θ1 x1 + · · · + θk xk , where θ1 + · · · + θk = 1, as an affine combination of the points x1 , . . . , xk . Using induction from the definition of affine set (i.e., that it contains every affine combination of two points in it), it can be shown that θ = 1.2
