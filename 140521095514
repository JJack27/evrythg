The Lagrange [ Lagrangian ] dual problem
For each pair (λ, ν) with λ 0, the Lagrange dual function gives us a lower bound
on the optimal value p⋆ of the optimization problem (5.1). Thus we have a lower
bound that depends on some parameters λ, ν. A natural question is: What is the
best lower bound that can be obtained from the Lagrange dual function?
This leads to the optimization problem
maximize
subject to
g(λ, ν)
λ 0.
(5.16)
This problem is called the Lagrange dual problem associated with the problem (5.1).
In this context the original problem (5.1) is sometimes called the primal problem.
