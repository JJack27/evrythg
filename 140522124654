It is straightforward to show that the Newton step reduces the
duality gap –– the difference between the dual and primal objective values
at the current point. Assume that x0 is primal feasible and ( 0, z0) is dual
feasible (Lustig et. al (1989) discuss the more general case). Let “gap(0)”
denote the current duality gap.
gap(0) = 0b – cx0
= 0(Ax0) – ( 0A – z0)Tx0
feasibility)
= (z0)Tx0
