EXERCISE 2
Problem 1: Diophantine Equation

a) Find two diﬀerent solutions for the following diophantine equation
(q + 2)(q + 3)X(q) + (q + 4)Y (q) = 1
b) Based on the previous solution, give a solution of
(q + 2)(q + 3)X(q) + (q + 4)Y (q) = (q 2 + a1 q + a0 )

Problem 2: Pole - Placement Design
Given the linear discrete-time plant
...
design a controller of the form
R(q)u = T (q)uc − S(q)y
which aﬀects the system output y(q) as shown in the block diagram cf. 140505232806 below. The controller design involves the calculation of polynomials R(q), T (q), and S(q), to achieve desired closed-loop behaviour.

a) By calculating the poles and zeros of the open-loop transfer function (1), what can be said about the dynamics of the uncontrolled system, i.e. is it stable or not, if stable, in what way?
b) Derive expressions for the closed-loop transfer functions
$G_{u_c}(q) = \ldots$
$G_v(q) = \ldots$

c) Let the desired closed-loop behaviour be deﬁned by the dynamics
y = Gm (q)uc =

k(bm0 q + bm1 )
Bm (q)
uc = 2
uc
Am (q)
q + am0 q + am1

(2)

Determine am1 , am0 , and k of the desired transfer function Gm , such that it has two poles p1,2 = 0.1
and unity static gain.
The equations that determine the controller polynomials T (q), R(q),
A(q)R(q) + B(q)S(q) = Ac (q)
B(q)T (q)
Bm (q)
=
Ac (q)
Am (q)

(3)

Here the choice of Ac (q) is still subject to controller design.
d) From (3), determine T (q) and the remaining parameter of Bm (q) by using an appropriate Bm (q).
Compare with the approach in the lecture.
e) What is a feasible choice for Ac (q)? Try Ac (q) = Am (q) and Ac (q) = Am (q)A0 (q) with A0 (q) =
q + 0.1.
f) Assume that the choice of the coeﬃcients a1 , a0 , b1 , and b0 of the polynomials in the process
transfer function
B(q)
b1 q + b0
G(q) =
= 2
A(q)
q + a1 q + a0
are only a ﬁrst guess. Formulate and discuss the algorithm that adapts these coeﬃcients online.
