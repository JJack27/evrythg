EXERCISE 4
Problem 1: Lyapunov for State Space Systems
Consider the nonlinear plant model
x˙ 1 = x2
x˙ 2 = ax21 + bx2 + u
y = x1
(1)
with states x1 , x2 ∈ R, input u ∈ R, output y ∈ R, and parameters a, b ∈ R.
a) Assuming that the parameters a and b are known, design a state feedback controller u(x1 , x2 ) such
that the behavior of (1) is given by the reference model
y = Gm (s)uref
ω2
Gm (s) = 2
s + 2ξωs + ω 2
b) Based on the above solution, design an adaptive controller for the case when a and b are unknown
and show that the system is stable.
Problem 2: Choice of Adaptive Control Law
In the system shown in the figure, determine rules for adjusting the parameters k1 and k2 so that the
output error e1 tends to zero.

a) Determine appropriate differential equations for the reference model, the plant, and the input from
the figure.
b) Transfer the differential equations in state space representation with matrices Am and Ap and vector
c) Find the elements of P , such that ATm P + P Am = −Q with Q = I in this case.
d) Determine the update rules for the parameters k1 and k2 , so that e1 approaches zero, by choosing
an appropriate Lyapunov function containing the weighting matrix P .
