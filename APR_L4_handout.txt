MIT-Rule: Gradient decent

Given: y(t) = Gθ (p)u(t),
ym (t) = Gm (p)uc (t)
Original version of Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) developed at MIT
MIT Rule: Use gradient descent method for parameter adaptation
One adjustable controller parameter θ
e = y − ym
adaption gain $\gamma$
MIT Rule Example 1/7
Given: stable SISO system
y(t) = kG(p)(u(t))
System output
Known stable transfer function
Constant unknown gain
Differential operator
\todo{What is the difference between $\operatorname{p}$ and $\operatorname{s}$? From the book they semm rather interchangeable.}
Problem: Find a controller u(t) =
T (p)
R(p) uc (t)
y(t)
G(s)
u(t)
ym (t) = Gm (p)(uc (t)) = k0 G(p)(uc (t))
where k0 is a given constant gain.
MIT Rule Example 2/7
If k were known:
ym (t) = k0 G(p)(uc (t))
Solution with a simple proportional controller:
u(t) = θuc (t),
Then:
y(t) = kG(p)(θuc (t)) = kG(p)(
uc (t)) = ym (t)
MIT Rule Example 3/7
Adaptation of θ:
Error between real and model outputs:
e(t, θ) = y(t) − ym (t) = kG(p)θ(t)uc (t) − k0 G(p)uc (t)
Goal: Update of θ(t), so that e(t, θ) → 0 for t → ∞
Jacobian as measure for e(t, θ):
J(t, θ) = |e(t, θ)|2
Time derivative (chain rule):
Negative time derivative:
MIT Rule Example 4/7
Sensitivity derivative:
[kG(p)θ(t)uc (t)] = kG(p)uc (t)
= k0 G(p)uc (t) = ym (t)
Adaptation law:
e = −2γ
ym (t)e(t, θ)
with arbitrary γ > 0, since γ = 2γ
with arbitrary γ > 0
θ = −γym (t)e(t, θ)
Remark: J(·) = |e(·)|
θ = −γym (t)sgn(e(t, θ))

Modiﬁcation to make adaptation independent of signal level:
with small constant $\alpha$ to avoid problems for Φ → 0
MIT Rule Summary
Adaptation law based on the gradient descent for minimizing the
error e = y − ym

θ = −γe
Choice of adaption gain is critical and depends on the signal level

Stability
The solution x(t) = 0 of the system
x(t) = f (x, t),
f (0, t) = 0, ∀t
is stable if for any ε > 0 there exists a number δ(ε) > 0 such that
||x(t0 )|| ≤ δ
||x(t, t0 )|| ≤ ε ∀t ≥ t0
Uniformly stable: δ(ε, t0 ) can be chosen independently on t0
Uniformly asymptotically stable: uniformly stable and ∀x(t0 )
||x(t, t0 )|| → 0
Simple Example
Stability of x = 0 of system
x(t) = −ax(t)
x(t, t0 ) = e−a(t−t0 ) x(t0 )
a≥0
−a(t − t0 ) ≤ 0 for t ≥ t0
|e−a(t−t0 ) | ≤ 1 for t ≥ t0
|x(t, t0 )| ≤ 1|x(t0 )| ≤ δ for t ≥ t0
Conclusion: uniform stability for δ = ε
|e−a(t−t0 ) | → 0 for t → ∞
|x(t, t0 )| → 0 for t → ∞
Conclusion: uniform asymptotic stability
Class κ functions
A continuous function α : [0, c(→ [0, ∞) is said to belong to class
it is strictly increasing
α(0) = 0
It belongs to class κ∞ , if c = ∞ and α(r) → ∞ as r → ∞
Positive deﬁnite and semideﬁnite functions
A continuously diﬀerentiable function V : Rn → R is called
positive deﬁnite in a region U ⊂ Rn containing the origin if
1. V (0) = 0
2. V (x) > 0,
x ∈ U and x = 0
A function is called positive semideﬁnite if Condition 2 is replaced
by V (x) ≥ 0.
A positive deﬁnite function has level curves that enclose the origin.
Velocity vector dx/dt = f (x) always points toward the
interior of the level curves
Solution that starts inside a given level curve can never pass
to the outside of the same level curve
Lyapunov’s Theorem
Let x = 0 be a stationary point of x = f (x, t). Let V (t, x) be a
continuously diﬀerentiable function such that
α1 (||x||) ≤ V (t, x) ≤ α2 (||x||)
V (t, x) =
f (x, t) ≤ −α3 (||x||)
for t ≥ 0, α1 (·) and α2 (·) ∈ κ
if α3 (·) ≥ 0, then x = 0 is uniformly stable
if α3 (·) ∈ κ, then x = 0 is uniformly asymptotically stable
Remarks on Lyapunov’s Theory
V is positive deﬁnite: α1 (||x||) ≤ V (t, x) means
V (t, x(t)) ≤ C
V (t, x) ≥ α1 (r)
||x(t)|| ≤ α1 (C)
V is decrescent: V (t, x) ≤ α2 (||x||) means
||x(t0 || ≤ δ
V (t, x) ≥ c
V (t0 , x(t0 )) ≤ α2 (δ) = C
||x(t)|| ≥ α2 (c)
Negative Lie derivative: V (t, x) ≤ 0 means
V (t, x(t)) is not increasing along the trajectories and
converges (to a non negative number).
||x(t)|| ≤ α1 (α2 (δ)) = ε
Lyapunov Equation
Stability of the solution x = 0 of the system
x(t) = Ax(t)
Consider the Lyapunov function
V (t, x) = xT P x
Note that with a positive deﬁnite P = P T > 0
α1 (||x||) ≡ λmin {P }||x||2 ≤ V (t, x) ≤ λmax {P }||x||2 ≡ α2 (||x||)
Computing derivative along the trajectories we have
_cf('140515164953')
V = xT (AT P + P A)x = −xT Qx ≡ −α3 (||x||)
provided the Lyapunov equation
is solved with P = P T > 0
Simple Example continued
Lyapunov equation for stability of solution x = 0 of system
_m('140515110414')
AT P + P A = −Q(−a)T P + P (−a) = −Q
\todo{Isn't the $-Q$ factor wrong?}
(2a)P = Q
For any Q > 0 the solution
is positive if and only if
Invariance Principle
LaSalle’s Theorem
Let Ω ⊂ D be a compact set that is positively invariant with respect
to x = f (x) : D → Rn
Let V : D → Rn be a continuously diﬀerentiable function such
that V ≤ 0 in Ω.
Let E be the set of all points in Ω where V = 0 . Let M be the
largest invariant set in E.
Then, every solution starting in Ω approaches M as t → ∞.
⇒ Valid only for time-invariant systems!
⇒ Asymptotic stability for negative semideﬁnite V
Barbalat’s Lemma
If g is a real function of a real variable t, deﬁned and uniformly
continuous for t ≥ 0, and if the limit of the integral
g(s)ds
exists and is a ﬁnite number, then
lim g(t) = 0
Remarks:
g(t) is uniformly continous ⇐ g(t) is bounded
g(t) and g(t) are bounded,
g (s)ds
< 0 ⇒ lim g(t) = 0
Boundedness and Convergence Set
Theorem: Consider a system x = f (t, x) where f (x, t) is
piecewise continuous in t and locally Lipschitz in x ∈ D, and
f (t, 0) is uniformly bounded for all t ≥ 0.
Let V (x, t) be a continuously diﬀerentiable function such that
W1 (x) ≤ V (x, t) ≤ W2 (x)
f (x, t) ≤ −W (x) ≤ 0
for t ≥ 0, where W1 (x), W2 (x) are continuous positive deﬁned and
radially unbounded, and W (x) is continuous positive semideﬁnite.
Take: r : ||x|| ≤ r ∈ D and deﬁne ρ = min {W1 (x)}
Then, for any x(t0 ) ∈ W2 (x) ≤ ρ:
x(t) is bounded for all t ≥ t0 .
W (x(t)) → 0 as t → ∞

Example 1/5
The system dynamics and the model to match are
y(t) = −ay(t) + bu(t),
ym (t) = −am ym (t) + bm uc (t)
The controller and the error signals are deﬁned by
u(t) = θ1 uc (t) − θ2 y(t),
e(t) = y(t) − ym (t)
Taking time derivative of e(t), we obtain
e = −am e − (bθ2 + a − am )y + (bθ1 − bm )uc
Introduce a Lyapunov function candidate as
V (x) =
e2 +
(bθ2 + a − am )2 (bθ1 − bm )2
where x(t) = [e(t), bθ2 (t) + a − am , bθ1 (t) − bm ]T
Example 2/5
Time derivative of
bθ2 + a − am ˙
V = ee +
= e (−am e − (bθ2 + a − am )y + (bθ1 − bm )uc ) +
θ2 − γye0 +
= −am e2 +
θ1 + γuc e0
Example 3/5
Choice of adaptation laws
θ1 = −γuc e,
θ2 = γye
leads to shaping the time-derivative for V as
V = −am e2 (t),
{→ this is W (x)}
Since V (x) = xT P x with P = diag{1, 1/(bγ), 1/(bγ)},
we conclude from the boundedness theorem that
x(t) = [e(t), bθ2 (t) + a − am , bθ1 (t) − bm ]T is bounded
W (x(t)) → 0
e(t) → 0
Remark: No guarantee for parameter convergence

General Case 1/2
Given a continuous time system and the target dynamics
Consider the controller and the error signals
u(t) = M uc (t) − Lx(t),
e(t) = x(t) − xm (t)
For a solvable model-matching problem, the error dynamics are
e = Ax + Bu − Am xm − Bm uc
= Am e + (A − Am − BL)x + (BM − Bm )uc
= Am e + Ψ(θ − θ0 )
Consider a Lyapunov function candidate
e P e + (θ − θ0 )T (θ − θ0 )
General Case 2/2
Time derivative of V =
eT P e + γ (θ − θ0 )T (θ − θ0 ) :
V = eT [P Am + AT P ]e + (θ − θ0 )T ΨT P e + (θ − θ0 )T θe
If we solve the Lyapunov equation for P
and choose the update law as
θ = −γΨT P e = −γΨT P (x − xm )
then
V = − eT (t)Qe(t)
and we conclude that e(t) → 0.
