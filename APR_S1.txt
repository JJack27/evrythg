EXERCISE 1 - SOLUTION
Problem 1: Parameter Identiﬁcation
a) Assuming that e(k) = 0, from the numerical values given in the problem description we can obtain
the following equations
c1 + c2
c1 + 2c2
c1 + 3c2
c1 + 4c2
c1 + 5c2

=1
=3
=3
=6
=7

The following vectors are obtained:
output vector Y 
regression matrix \Phi 
parameter vector \theta 

, and

With Y , Φ, and θ deﬁned, the cost function V is given by
1
V (θ, k) = (Y − Φθ)T (Y − Φθ)
2

(1)

b) General solution for ﬁnding θ:
From (1) we get
1
V (θ, k) = (Y T Y − Y T Φθ − θT ΦT Y + θT ΦT Φθ)
2
1 T
= (Y Y − 2Y T Φθ + θT ΦT Φθ)
2
A minimum is reached when gradθ V (θ, k) is zero. Taking the derivative of V along θ and setting
the RHS to zero, we get
∂V
= −Y T Φ + θT ΦT Φ = 0
(2)
∂θ
Solving (2) for θ we get
θ = P (k)ΦT Y
where P (k) = (ΦT Φ)−1 . The assumption is that (ΦT Φ)−1 exists (excitation condition).

With the numerical values given in the problem description we can compute the following matrices:

from numpy import array
from numpy import dot
from numpy import ones
from numpy import arange
from numpy.linalg import inv
Phi = array([ones(5), arange(5) + 1]).T
Y = array([1, 3, 3, 6, 7]).T
P_ = inv(dot(Phi.T, Phi))
tH_ = dot(dot(P_, Phi.T), Y)

=

and ﬁnally, replacing the values in (3) we obtain
θ = (ΦT Φ)−1 ΦT Y =

c) The estimated value for the ﬁrst 5 samples is θ(k − 1) =
obtained previously:
1.5
The new data set u(6) = 6, y(6) = 7 adds the equation c1 + 6c2 = 7. This implies a new row to
the regression matrix Φ derived above and an additional entry to the output vector Y , hence
ϕ(k) = 1 6
y(k) = 7

T

The recursion formula for updating the parameter vector is given by
ˆ
ˆ
ˆ
θ(k) = θ(k − 1) + K(k) y(k) − ϕT (k)θ(k − 1)
where K(k) is given by
K(k) = P (k − 1)ϕ(k) I + ϕT (k)P (k − 1)ϕ(k)


−1

with P (k − 1) = (ΦT (k − 1)Φ(k − 1))−1 .

Numerical evaluation yields
phi = array([[1], [6]])
y = array([7])
K = dot(dot(P_,  phi), inv(1 + dot(dot(phi.T, P_) , phi)))

and the updated parameter vector
tH = tH_ + dot(K, y - dot(phi.T , tH_))

d) The discrete-time dynamic system is given by y(k) = a1 u(k − 1) + a2 u(k − 2). Assuming that
u(k) = 0 ∀ k, and dividing by u(k − 1), the system becomes
u(k − 2)
y(k)
= a1 + a2
u(k − 1)
u(k − 1)
y (k) = a1 + a2 u(k)
˜
˜
which is in the same form as the stationary process y(k) = c1 + c2 u(k) + e(k).

Problem 2: Discrete-Time Control Systems
a) The general solution for a continuous-time dynamic system with initial condition y_c(t0) = y0 is
given by

t

ea(t−τ ) buc (τ )dτ

yc (t) = ea(t−t0 ) y0 +
t0

The state of the system at sampling time (k + 1)T starting at time kT is therefore given by
(k+1)T

y(k + 1) = yc ((k + 1)T ) = ea((k+1)T −kT ) y(kT ) +

ea((k+1)T −τ ) b uc (τ )dτ
kT

(k+1)T

ea((k+1)T −τ ) dτ b u(kT )

= eaT y(kT ) +

(4)

kT

Note, that the control input u(t) is constant in the interval [kT; (k + 1)T]. The integral in (4) can
be evaluated and we get
y((k + 1)T ) = eaT y(kT ) + (eaT − 1) b u(kT )

\todo{Shouldn't it be $1 - \exp(aT)$?}

Setting c := eaT and d := a (eaT − 1)b answers the question.

As the system is scalar, the eigenvalues of the open-loop system are given by the constant a. In
the continuous-time case if a < 0, the system is stable. If a < 0, then c = eaT < 1 which
means stability in the discrete-time case. If a > 0, then c > 1. The stability properties of the
continuous-time system carry over to the discrete-time system.
b) Applying the feedback u(k) = −K_p y(k) to the dynamic system y(k + 1) = cy(k) + du(k), the
closed-loop system
y(k + 1) = ay(k)
a = (c − d K_p )
is formed. From the previous results, only the constant a can be found, whereas the constants c
and d cannot be found uniquely.

Problem 3: Regressor Models
a) Continuous-time transfer function
[ Multiplication with s corresponds to the derivative ]
[ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_transform#Proof_of_the_Laplace_transform_of_a_function.27s_derivative ]

b) Non-linear system
x(k) = −x(k − 1)2 2sin(u(k − 1))

b

(6)

c) State space model
The ODE which is given through the state space model is given by
y = ay + by + cu

and the regressor model is therefore given by
[ \dot{x}_1 = x_2 ]
