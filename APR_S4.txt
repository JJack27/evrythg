EXERCISE 4 - SOLUTION
Problem 1: Lyapunov theory for state space systems
a) Write the reference model Gm in state-space form
xm1 = xm2
xm2 = −ω 2 xm1 − 2ξωxm2 + ω 2 uref
From the above system, we see that the input
u = −ax2 − bx2 − ω 2 x1 − 2ξωx2 + ω 2 uref
which leads to the desired behavior
ax2 + bx2 + (−ax2 − bx2 − ω 2 x1 − 2ξωx2 + ω 2 uref )
−ω 2 x1 − 2ξωx2 + ω 2 uref
b) If the parameters a and b are unknown, we have to replace them by their estimates a and ˆ
respectively. This leads to the controller
u = −ˆx2 − ˆ 2 − ω 2 x1 − 2ξωx2 + ω 2 uref
a 1 bx
Plugging (1) into the system model leads to
˜ 1
˜ 2 − ω 2 x1 − 2ξωx2 + ω 2 uref
where a = a − a and ˜ = b − ˆ Deﬁning the error as e = e1 e2
error equation
= x − xm , we get the following
˜ 2 − ω 2 e1 − 2ξωe2 = −ω 2 −2ξω e + ax2 + ˜ 2
˜ 1 bx

We choose the Lyapunov function

of the associated Lyapunov equation. The derivative of [ the quadratic Lyapunov fuction ] V is given by

and P is the solution
follows that the system is stable.

where Am =

Problem 2: Choice of an adaptive control law
a) Diﬀerential equation of the reference model: ym + ym + ym = r.
Diﬀerential equation of the plant: yp + (−1 − k1 )yp + (−k2 )yp = r.
Diﬀerential equations of the controller: u = r + k1 yp + k2 yp .
b) State space representations of the plant and the model are given by:
xp = Ap xp + br
xm = Am xm + br
with xp =
, Ap =
and with xm = m , Am =
−1 −1
k2 1 + k1
The expression of the controller in state space form is given by
with φT = k2 1 + k1 .
\todo{Is this correct? I would say $u = r + [k_2, k_1] [x_{p1}; x_{p2}]$}
c) Verifying if Am is a stable matrix:
|λI − Am | = λ2 + λ + 1 = 0 ⇒ λ1,2 =
Pick Q = I:
0 −1
1 −1
p1 p2
p2 p3
−1± 1−4
⇒ Re(λ1,2 ) = −0.5 ⇒ asymptotically stable matrix
Solving for p we obtain
p2 = 0.5
p3 = 1
p1 = 1.5
d) Deﬁne error e = xp − xm and obtain the expression of error dynamics
e = Am e + bφT xp
Lyapunov function candidate: V (e, φ) = eT P e + φT φ
Obtain the derivative V (e, φ)
V = eT P (Am e + bφT xp ) + (xT φbT + eT AT )P e + 2φT φ
Regrouping the scalar value eT P bφT xp = xT φbT P e = φT xp eT P b and choosing the update law
˙ = −xp eT P b the following result for the derivative of the Lyapunov function is obtained:
V = eT (P Am + AT P )e + 2φT (xp eT P b + φ)
= −eT Qe ≤ 0
The adaptive laws can be computed as
φ = ˙ 2 = −xp eT P b = − p
e1 + 2e2
k2 = −
k1 = −
