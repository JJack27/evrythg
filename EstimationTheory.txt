Some Examples
Range estimation : We transmit a pulse that is reﬂected by the aircraft.
An echo is received after τ second. Range θ is estimated from the equation
θ = τ c/2 where c is the light’s speed.
System identiﬁcation : The input of a plant is excited with u and the
output signal y is measured. If we have :
y [k] = G (q −1 , θ)u[k] + n[k]
where n[k] is the measurement noise. The model parameters are estimated
using u[k] and y [k] for k = 1, . . . , N.
DC level in noise : Consider a set of data {x[0], x[1], . . . , x[N − 1]} that
can be modeled as :
where w [n] is some zero mean noise process. A can be estimated using the
measured data set.

Review of Probability and Random Variables
(Probability and Random Variables)
Estimation Theory
Random Variables
Random Variable : A rule X (·) that assigns to every element of a sample
space Ω a real value is called a RV. So X is not really a variable that varies
randomly but a function whose domain is Ω and whose range is some
subset of the real line.
Example : Consider the experiment of ﬂipping a coin twice. The sample
space (the possible outcomes) is :
We can deﬁne a random variable X such that
X (HH) = 1, X (HT ) = 1.1, X (TH) = 1.6, X (TT ) = 1.8
Random variable X assigns to each event (e.g. E = {HT , TH} ⊂ Ω) a
subset of the real line (in this case B = {1.1, 1.6}).
(Probability and Random Variables)
Estimation Theory
Probability Distribution Function
For any element ζ in Ω, the event {ζ|X (ζ) ≤ x} is an important event.
The probability of this event
Pr [{ζ|X (ζ) ≤ x}] = PX (x)
is called the probability distribution function of X .
Example : For the random variable deﬁned earlier, we have :
PX (1.5) = Pr [{ζ|X (ζ) ≤ 1.5}] = Pr [{HH, HT }] = 0.5
PX (x) can be computed for all x ∈ R. It is clear that 0 ≤ PX (x) ≤ 1.
Remark :
For the same experiment (throwing a coin twice) we could deﬁne
another random variable that would lead to a diﬀerent PX (x).
In most of engineering problems the sample space is a subset of the
real line so X (ζ) = ζ and PX (x) is a continuous function of x.

The Probability Density Function, if it exists, is given by :

Gaussian Probability Density Function
A random variable is distributed according to a Gaussian or normal
distribution if the PDF is given by :
p(x) = √
e−
(x−µ)2
The PDF has two parameters : µ, the mean and σ 2 the variance.
We note X ∼ N (µ, σ 2 ) when the random variable X has a normal
(Gaussian) distribution with the mean µ and the standard deviation σ.
Small σ means small variability (uncertainty) and large σ means large
variability.
Remark : Gaussian distribution is important because according to the
Central Limit Theorem the sum of N independent RVs has a PDF that
converges to a Gaussian distribution when N goes to inﬁnity.

Joint, Marginal and Conditional PDF
Joint PDF : Consider two random variables X and Y then :
Pr [x1 < X ≤ x2 and y1 < Y ≤ y2 ] =
p(x, y )dxdy
Marginal PDF :
p(x, y )dy
p(x) =
and
p(y ) =
p(x, y )dx
Conditional PDF : p(x|y ) is deﬁned as the PDF of X conditioned on
knowing the value of Y .
Bayes’ Formula : Consider two RVs deﬁned on the same probability space
then we have :
p(x, y )
p(x|y ) =
p(x, y ) = p(x|y )p(y ) = p(y |x)p(x)
p(y )
(Probability and Random Variables)
Estimation Theory
Independent Random Variables
Two RVs X and Y are independent if and only if :
p(x, y ) = p(x)p(y )
A direct conclusion is that :
p(x|y ) =
p(x)p(y )
p(x, y )
= p(x)
p(y )
p(y )
and
p(y |x) = p(y )
which means conditioning does not change the PDF.
Remark : For a joint Gaussian pdf the contours of constant density is an
ellipse centered at (µx , µy ). For independent X and Y the major (or
minor) axis is parallel to x or y axis.

Expected Value of a Random Variable
The expected value, if it exists, of a random variable X with PDF p(x) is
deﬁned by :
xp(x)dx
E (X ) =
Some properties of expected value :
E {aX } = aE {X }
The expected value of Y = g (X ) can be computed by :

Moments of a Random Variable
The r th moment of X is deﬁned as :
E (X r ) =
x r p(x)dx
The ﬁrst moment of X is its expected value or the mean (µ = E (X )).
Moments of Gaussian RVs : A Gaussian RV with N (µ, σ 2 ) has
moments of all orders in closed form
E (X )
E (X 2 )
E (X 3 )

Central Moments
The r th central moment of X is deﬁned as :
E [(X − µ)r ] =
(x − µ)r p(x)dx
The second central moment (variance) is denoted by σ 2 or var(X ).
Central Moments of Gaussian RVs :
E [(X − µ)r ] =
σ r (r − 1)!! if r is even
where n!! denotes the double factorial that is the product of every odd
number from n to 1.

Some properties of Gaussian RVs
If X ∼ N (µx , σx ) then Z = (X − µx )/σx ∼ N (0, 1).
If Z ∼ N (0, 1) then X = σx Z + µx ∼ N (µx , σx ).
If X ∼ N (µx , σx ) then Z = aX + b ∼ N (aµx + b, a2 σx ).
If X ∼ N (µx , σx ) and Y ∼ N (µy , σy ) are two independent RVs, then
aX + bY ∼ N (aµx + bµy , aσx + bσy )
The sum of square of n independent RV with standard normal
distribution N (0, 1) has a χ2 distribution with n degree of freedom.
For large value of n, χ2 converges to N (n, 2n).
The Euclidian norm X 2 + Y 2 of two independent RVs with
standard normal distribution has the Rayleigh distribution.
(Probability and Random Variables)
Estimation Theory
Covariance
For two RVs X and Y , the covariance is deﬁned as
σxy = E [(X − µx )(Y − µy )]
(x − µx )(y − µy )p(x, y )dxdy
If X and Y are zero mean then σxy = E {XY }.
var(X + Y ) = σx + σy + 2σxy
var(aX ) = a2 σx
Important formula : The relation between the variance and the mean of
X is given by
σ 2 = E [(X − µ)2 ] = E (X 2 ) − 2µE (X ) + µ2
= E (X 2 ) − µ2
The variance is the mean of the square minus the square of the mean.

The Mathematical Estimation Problem
Parameter Estimation Problem : Given a set of measured data
which depends on an unknown parameter vector θ, determine an estimator
θ = g (x[0], x[1], . . . , x[N − 1])
where g is some function.
The ﬁrst step is to ﬁnd the PDF of data as a
function of θ : p(x; θ)
Example : Consider the problem of DC level in white Gaussian noise with
one observed data x[0] = θ + w [0] where w [0] has the PDF N (0, σ 2 ).
Then the PDF of x[0] is :
p(x[0]; θ) = √

The Mathematical Estimation Problem
Example : Consider a data sequence that can be modeled with a linear
trend in white Gaussian noise
Suppose that w [n] ∼ N (0, σ 2 ) and is uncorrelated with all the other
samples. Letting θ = [A B] and x = [x[0], x[1], . . . , x[N − 1]] the PDF is :

Classical versus Bayesian estimation
If we assume θ is deterministic we will have a classical estimation
problem. The following method will be studied : MVU, MLE, BLUE,
If we assume θ is a random variable with a known PDF, then we will
have a Bayesian estimation problem. In this case the data are
described as the joint PDF
p(x, θ) = p(x|θ)p(θ)
where p(θ) summarizes our knowledge about θ before any data is
observed and p(x|θ) summarizes our knowledge provided by data x
conditioned on knowing θ. The following methods will be studied :
MMSE, MAP, Kalman Filter.

Assessing Estimator Performance
Consider the problem of estimating a DC level A in uncorrelated noise :
Consider the following estimators :
Suppose that A = 1, A1 = 0.95 and A2 = 0.98. Which estimator is better ?
An estimator is a random variable, so its
performance can only be described by its PDF or
statistically (e.g. by Monte-Carlo simulation).
(Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimation)
Estimation Theory
Unbiased Estimators
An estimator that on the average yield the true value is unbiased.
Mathematically
E (θ − θ) = 0
for a < θ < b
Let’s compute the expectation of the two estimators A1 and A2 :
E (A1 ) =
E (x[n]) =
E (A + w [n]) =
(A + 0) = A
E (A2 ) = E (x[0]) = E (A + w [0]) = A + 0 = A
Both estimators are unbiased. Which one is better ?
Now, let’s compute the variance of the two estimators :
var(A1 ) = var
var(x[n]) =
var(A2 ) = var(x[0]) = σ 2 > var (A1 )
(Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimation)
Estimation Theory
Unbiased Estimators
Remark : When several unbiased estimators of the same parameters from
independent set of data are available, i.e., θ1 , θ2 , . . . , θn , a better estimator
can be obtained by averaging :
E (θ) = θ
Assuming that the estimators have the same variance, we have :
var(θ) = 2
var(θi ) =
var(θi )
n var(θi ) =
By increasing n, the variance will decrease (if n → ∞, θ → θ).
It is not the case for biased estimators, no matter how many estimators are
averaged.
(Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimation)
Estimation Theory
Minimum Variance Criterion
The most logical criterion for estimation is the Mean Square Error (MSE) :
mse(θ) = E [(θ − θ)2 ]
Unfortunately this type of estimators leads to unrealizable estimators (the
estimator will depend on θ).
mse(θ) = E {[θ − E (θ) + E (θ) − θ]2 } = E {[θ − E (θ) + b(θ)]2 }
where b(θ) = E (θ) − θ is deﬁned as the bias of the estimator. Therefore :
mse(θ) = E {[θ − E (θ)]2 } + 2b(θ)E [θ − E (θ)] + b 2 (θ) = var(θ) + b 2 (θ)
Instead of minimizing MSE we can minimize the variance of
the unbiased estimators :

CRLB is a lower bound on the variance of any unbiased estimator.

to be eﬃcient.

Transformation of Parameters
Solution : Knowing that x ∼ N (A, σ 2 /N), we have :
E (¯2 ) = E 2 (¯) + var(¯) = A2 +
So the estimator A2 = x 2 is not even unbiased.
Let’s look at the variance of this estimator :
var(¯2 ) = E (¯4 ) − E 2 (¯2 )
but we have from the moments of Gaussian RVs (slide 15) :
E (¯4 ) = A4 + 6A2
+ 3( )2
Therefore :
var(¯2 ) = A4 + 6A2

Transformation of Parameters
Remarks :
The estimator A2 = x 2 is biased and not eﬃcient.
As N → ∞ the bias goes to zero and the variance of the estimator
approaches the CRLB. This type of estimators are called
asymptotically eﬃcient.
General Remarks :
If g (θ) = aθ + b is an aﬃne function of θ, then g (θ) = g (θ) is an

eﬃcient estimator. First, it is unbiased : E (aθ
moreover :
var(θ) = a2 var(θ)
var(g (θ)) ≥
but var(g (θ)) = var(aθ + b) = a2 var(θ), so that the CRLB is
achieved.
If g (θ) is a nonlinear function of θ and θ is an eﬃcient estimator,

Linear Models with WGN
For a linear model with WGN represented by x = Hθ + w the MVU
estimator is :
θ = (HT H)−1 HT x
This estimator is eﬃcient and attains the CRLB.
That the estimator is unbiased can be seen easily by :
E (θ) = (HT H)−1 HT E (Hθ + w) = θ
The statistical performance of θ is completely speciﬁed because θ is a
linear transformation of a Gaussian vector x and hence has a Gaussian

Linear Models with Colored Gaussian Noise
Determine the MVU estimator for the linear model x = Hθ + w with w a
colored Gaussian noise with N (0, C).
Whitening approach : Since C is positive deﬁnite, its inverse can be
factored as C−1 = DT D where D is an invertible matrix. This matrix acts
as a whitening transformation for w :
E [(Dw)(Dw)T ] = E (DwwT D) = DCDT = DD−1 D−T D = I
Now if we transform the linear model x = Hθ + w to :
where w = Dw ∼ N (0, I) is white and we can compute the MVU
estimator as :

Linear Models with known components
Consider a linear model x = Hθ + s + w, where s is a known signal. To
determine the MVU estimator let x = x − s, so that x = Hθ + w is a
standard linear model. The MVU estimator is :
θ = (HT H)−1 HT (x − s) with C ˆ = σ 2 (HT H)−1

Best Linear Unbiased Estimators (BLUE)
Problems of ﬁnding the MVU estimators :
The MVU estimator does not always exist or impossible to ﬁnd.
The PDF of data may be unknown.
BLUE is a suboptimal estimator that :
restricts estimates to be linear in data ;
restricts estimates to be unbiased ;
E (θ) = AE (x) = θ
minimizes the variance of the estimates ;
needs only the mean and the variance of the data (not the PDF). As
a result, in general, the PDF of the estimates cannot be computed.
Remark : The unbiasedness restriction implies a linear model for the data.
However, it may still be used if the data are transformed suitably or the
model is linearized.

If the data are of the general linear model form

Asymptotic Properties of Estimators
Asymptotic Unbiasedness : Estimator θN is an asymptotically unbiased
estimator of θ if :
lim E (θN − θ) = 0
Asymptotic Distribution : It refers to p(xn ) as it evolves from
n = 1, 2, . . ., especially for large value of n (it is not the ultimate form of
distribution, which may be degenerate).
Asymptotic Variance : is not equal to lim var(θN ) (which is the
limiting variance). It is deﬁned as :
lim E {N[θN − lim E (θN )]2 }
asymptotic var(θN ) =

mean-squared sense, if :
lim E [(θN − θ)2 ] = 0
(Maximum Likelihood Estimation)
Estimation Theory
Consistency
Estimator θN is a consistent estimator of θ if for every
plim(θN ) = θ
Remarks :
If θN is asymptotically unbiased and its limiting variance is zero then
it converges to θ in mean-square.
If θN converges to θ in mean-square, then the estimator is consistent.
Asymptotic unbiasedness does not imply consistency and vice versa.
plim can be treated as an operator, e.g. :
plim(xy ) = plim(x)plim(y ) ;
plim(x)
plim(y )
The importance of consistency is that any continuous function of a
consistent estimator is itself a consistent estimator.

The MLE of the parameter α = g (θ), where the PDF p(x; θ) is
parameterized by θ, is given by
α = g (θ)
where θ is the MLE of θ.
It can be proved using the property of the consistent estimators.
If α = g (θ) is a one-to-one function, then

Remarks :
The Hessian can be replaced by the negative of its expectation, the

The Least Squares Approach
In all the previous methods we assumed that the measured signal x[n] is
the sum of a true signal s[n] and a measurement error w [n] with known
probabilistic model. In least squares method
x[n] = s[n, θ] + e[n]
where e(n) represents the modeling and measurement errors. The objective
is to minimize the LS cost :
(x[n] − s[n, θ])2
J(θ) =
We do not need a probabilistic assumption but only
a deterministic signal model.
It has a broader range of applications.
No claim about the optimality can be made.

Weighted Linear Least Squares
The LS criterion can be modiﬁed by including a positive deﬁnite
(symmetric) weighting matrix W :
J(θ) = (x − Hθ)T W(x − Hθ)
That leads to the following estimator :
θ = (HT WH)−1 HT Wx
and minimum LS cost :
Jmin = xT [W − WH(HT WH)−1 HT W]x
Remark : If we take W = C−1 , where C is the covariance of noise then
weighted least squares estimator is the BLUE. However, there is no true
LS-based reason for this choice.

Geometrical Interpretation
Recall the general signal model s = Hθ. If we denote the column of H by
hi we have :
The signal model is a linear combination of the vectors {hi }.
The LS minimizes the length of the error vector between the data and
the signal model = x − s :
J(θ) = (x − Hθ)T (x − Hθ) = x − Hθ
The data vector can lie anywhere in R N , while signal vectors must lie
in a p-dimensional subspace of R N , termed S p , which is spanned by
the column of H.
(Least Squares)
Estimation Theory
Geometrical Interpretation (Orthogonal Projection)
Intuitively, it is clear that the LS error is minimized when ˆ = Hθ is
the orthogonal projection of x onto S
So the LS error vector = x − ˆ is orthogonal to all columns of H :
HT (x − Hθ) = 0
θ = (HT H)−1 HT x
The signal estimate is the projection of x onto S p :
ˆ = Hθ = H(HT H)−1 HT x = Px
where P is the orthogonal projection matrix.
Note that if z ∈ Range(H), then Pz = z. Recall that Range(H) is the
subspace spanned by the columns of H.
Now, since Px ∈ S p then P(Px) = Px. Therefore any projection
matrix is idempotent, i.e. P2 = P.
It can be veriﬁed that P is symmetric and singular (with rank p).

Geometrical Interpretation (Orthonormal columns of H)
Recall that
If the columns of H are orthonormal then HT H = I and θ = HT x.
In this case we have θi = h x, thus

If we increase the number of parameters (the order of the linear
model), we can easily compute the new estimate.

Choosing the Model Order
Suppose that you have a set of data and the objective is to ﬁt a
polynomial to data. What is the best polynomial order ?
Remarks :
It is clear that by increasing the order Jmin is monotonically
non-increasing.
By choosing p = N we can perfectly ﬁt the data to model. However,
we ﬁt the noise as well.
We should choose the simplest model that adequately describes the
data.
We increase the order only if the cost reduction is signiﬁcant.
If we have an idea about the expected level of Jmin , we increase p to
approximately attain this level.
There is an order-recursive LS algorithm to eﬃciently compute a
(p + 1)-th order model based on a p-th order one (See 8.6).

Bayesian Linear Model
Let the data be modeled as
where θ is a p × 1 random vector with prior PDF N (µθ , Cθ ) and w is a
noise vector with PDF N (0, Cw ).
Since θ and w are independent and Gaussian, they are jointly Gaussian
then the posterior PDF is also Gaussian. In order to ﬁnd the MMSE
estimator we should compute the covariance matrices :

= E {(Hθ + w − Hµθ )(Hθ + w − Hµθ )T }

If the observed data can be modeled as

Gaussian with mean :

Deﬁnition (Nuisance Parameter)
Suppose that θ and α are unknown parameters but we are only interested
in estimating θ. In this case α is called a nuisance parameter.
In the classical approach we have to estimate both but in the
Bayesian approach we can integrate it out.
Note that in the Bayesian approach we can ﬁnd p(θ|x) from p(θ, α|x)
as a marginal PDF :
p(θ, α|x)d α
p(θ|x) =

A general Bayesian estimator is obtained by minimizing the Bayes Risk
θ = arg min R(θ)
where R(θ) = E {C (ε)} is the Bayes Risk, C (ε) is a cost function and
ε = θ − θ is the estimation error.
Three common risk functions
1. Quadratic :
R(θ) = E {ε2 } = E {(θ − θ)2 }
2. Absolute :
R(θ) = E {|ε|} = E {|θ − θ|}

g (θ) =

For this case R(θ) = E {(θ − θ)2 } =Bmse(θ) which leads to the MMSE
estimator with
θ = E (θ|x)
so θ is the mean of the posterior PDF p(θ|x).

In this case we have :
g (θ) =
|θ − θ|p(θ|x)d θ =
(θ − θ)p(θ|x)d θ +
(θ − θ)p(θ|x)d θ
By setting the derivative of g (θ) equal to zero and the use of Leibnitz’s
rule, we get :
p(θ|x)d θ =
p(θ|x)d θ
Then θ is the median (area to the left=area to the right) of p(θ|x)

For δ arbitrarily small the optimal estimate is the location of the
maximum of p(θ|x) or the mode of the posterior PDF.
This estimator is called the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator.

PDF), the mean and the mode and the median are the same.

Properties of MMSE Estimators
For Bayesian Linear Model, poor prior knowledge leads to MVU
estimator.
θ = E (θ|x) = µθ + (C−1 + HT C−1 H)−1 HT C−1 (x − Hµθ )
For no prior knowledge µθ → 0 and C−1 → 0, and therefore :
Commutes over aﬃne transformations.
Suppose that α = Aθ + b then the MMSE estimator for α is
α = E (α|x) = E (Aθ + b|x) = AE (θ|x) + b = Aθ + b
Enjoys the additive property for independent data sets.
Assume that θ, x1 , x2 are jointly Gaussian with x1 and x2

Maximum A Posteriori Estimators
In the MAP estimation approach we have :

p(x)
An equivalent maximization is :
θ = arg max p(x|θ)p(θ)
θ = arg max[ln p(x|θ) + ln p(θ)]
If p(θ) is uniform or is approximately constant around the maximum
of p(x|θ) (for large data length), we can remove p(θ) to obtain the
Bayesian Maximum Likelihood :
θ = arg max p(x|θ)

Extension to the vector parameter case
θ1 = arg max p(θ1 |x) = arg max
p(θ|x)dθ2 . . . dθp
This needs integral evaluation of the marginal conditional PDFs.
An alternative is the following vector MAP estimator that maximizes the
joint conditional PDF :
θ = arg max p(θ|x) = arg max p(x|θ)p(θ)
This corresponds to a circular Hit-or-Miss cost function.
In general, as N → ∞, the MAP estimator → the Bayesian MLE.
If the posterior PDF is Gaussian, the mode is identical to the mean,
therefore the MAP estimator is identical to the MMSE estimator.
The invariance property in ML theory does not hold for the MAP
estimator.

Performance Description
In the classical estimation the mean and the variance of the estimate
(or its PDF) indicates the performance of the estimator.
In the Bayesian approach the PDF of the estimate is diﬀerent for each
realization of θ. So a good estimator should perform well for every
possible value of θ.
The estimation error ε = θ − θ is a function of two random variables
(θ and x).
The mean and the variance of the estimation error, wrt two random
variables, indicates the performance of the estimator.
The mean value of the estimation error is zero. So the estimates are
unbiased (in the Bayesian sense).
Ex,θ (θ − θ) = Ex,θ (θ − E (θ|x)) = Ex [Eθ|x (θ) − Eθ|x (θ|x)] = Ex (0) = 0
The variance of the estimate is Bmse :
var(ε) = Ex,θ (ε2 ) = Ex,θ [(θ − θ)2 ] = Bmse(θ)
(General Bayesian Estimators)
Estimation Theory
Performance Description (Vector Parameter Case)
The vector of the estimation error is ε = θ − θ and has a zero mean.
Its covariance matrix is :
Mθ = Ex,θ (εεT ) = Ex,θ {[θ − E (θ|x)][θ − E (θ|x)]T }
= Ex Eθ|x [θ − E (θ|x)][θ − E (θ|x)]T
= Ex (Cθ|x )
if x and θ are jointly Gaussian, we have :
since Cθ|x does not depend on x.
For a Bayesian linear model we have :
Mθ = Cθ|x = Cθ − Cθ HT (HCθ HT + Cw )−1 HCθ
In this case ε is a linear transformation of x and θ and thus is
Gaussian. Therefore :
ε ∼ N (0, Mθ )

This leads to the Linear MMSE Estimator :
Which is a suboptimal estimator that can be easily implemented.

Kalman ﬁlter is a generalization of the Wiener ﬁlter.
In Wiener ﬁlter we estimate s[n] based on the noisy observation
vector x[n]. We assume that s[n] is a stationary random process with
known mean and covariance matrix.
In Kalman ﬁlter we assume that s[n] is a non stationary random
process whose mean and covariance matrix vary according to a known
dynamical model.
Kalman ﬁlter is a sequential MMSE estimator of s[n]. If the signal
and noise are jointly Gaussian, then the Kalman ﬁlter is an optimal
MMSE estimator, if not, it is the optimal LMMSE estimator.
Kalman ﬁlter has many applications in Control theory for state
estimation.
It can be generalized to vector signals and noise (in contrast to

magnitude. The r × 1 vector u[n] ∼ N (0, Q) and the initial condition is a
p × 1 random vector with s[n] ∼ N (µs , Cs ) and is independent of u[n]’s.
Then, the signal process is Gaussian with mean E (s[n]) = An+1 µs and
covariance :
for m ≥ n and Cs [m, n] = Cs [n, m] for m < n. The covariance matrix
C[n] = Cs [n, n] and the mean and covariance propagation equations are :
E (s[n]) = AE (s[n − 1]) , C[n] = AC[n − 1]AT + BQBT

Data model :

Observation equation
s[n] = as[n − 1] + u[n]
u[n] is zero mean Gaussian noise with independent samples and
E (u 2 [n]) = σu .
w [n] is zero mean Gaussian noise with independent samples and
E (w 2 [n]) = σn (time-varying variance).
s[−1] ∼ N (µs , σs ) (for simplicity we suppose that µs = 0).
s[−1], u[n] and w [n] are independent.
Objective : Develop a sequential MMSE estimator to estimate s[n] based
on the data X[n] = x[0], x[1], . . . , x[n] . This estimator is the mean of
posterior PDF :
ˆ[n|n] = E (s[n] x[0], x[1], . . . , x[n])

Scalar Kalman Filter
To develop the equations of a Kalman ﬁlter we need the following
properties :
Property 1 : For two uncorrelated jointly Gaussian data vector, the
MMSE estimator θ (if it is zero mean) is given by :
θ = E (θ|x1 , x2 ) = E (θ|x1 ) + E (θ|x2 )
Property 2 : If θ = θ1 + θ2 , then the MMSE estimator of θ is :
θ = E (θ|x) = E (θ1 + θ2 |x) = E (θ1 |x) + E (θ2 |x)
Basic Idea : Generate the innovation x [n] = x[n] − x [n|n − 1] which is
uncorrelated with previous samples X[n − 1]. Then use x [n] instead of x[n]
for estimation (X[n] is equivalent to X[n − 1], x [n] ).

From Property 1, we have :
ˆ[n|n] = E (s[n] X[n − 1], x [n]) = E (s[n] X[n − 1]) + E (s[n] x [n])
= ˆ[n|n − 1] + E (s[n] x [n])
From Property 2, we have :
ˆ[n|n − 1] = E (as[n − 1] + u[n] X[n − 1])
= aE (s[n − 1] X[n − 1]) + E (u[n] X[n − 1])
= aˆ[n − 1|n − 1]
The MMSE estimator of s[n] based on x [n] is :
E (s[n] x [n]) =
E (s[n]˜(n))
x [n] = K [n](x[n] − x [n|n − 1])
E (˜
where x [n|n − 1] = ˆ[n|n − 1] + w[n|n − 1] = ˆ[n|n − 1].
Finally we have :
ˆ[n|n] = aˆ[n − 1|n − 1] + K [n](x[n] − ˆ[n|n − 1])

Properties of Kalman Filter
The Kalman ﬁlter is an extension of the sequential MMSE estimator
but applied to time-varying parameters that are represented by a
dynamic model.
No matrix inversion is required.
The Kalman ﬁlter is a time-varying linear ﬁlter.
The Kalman ﬁlter computes (and uses) its own performance measure,
the Bayesian MSE M[n|n].
The prediction stage increases the error, while the correction stage
decreases it.
The Kalman ﬁlter generates an uncorrelated sequence from the
observations so can be viewed as a whitening ﬁlter.
The Kalman ﬁlter is optimal in the Gaussian case and the optimal
LMMSE estimator if the Gaussian assumption is not valid.
In KF M[n|n], M[n|n − 1] and K [n] do not depend on the
measurement and can be computed oﬀ line. At steady state (n → ∞)
the Kalman ﬁlter becomes an LTI ﬁlter (M[n|n], M[n|n − 1] and K [n]
become constant).

Extended Kalman Filter
The extended Kalman ﬁlter is a sub-optimal approach when the state
and the observation equations are nonlinear.
Nonlinear data model : Consider the following nonlinear data model
s[n] = f(s[n − 1]) + Bu[n]
x[n] = g(s[n]) + w[n]
where f(·) and g(·) are nonlinear function mapping (vector to vector).
Model linearization : We linearize the model around the estimated value
of s using a ﬁrst order Taylor series.
f(s[n − 1]) ≈ f(ˆ[n − 1|n − 1]) +
g(s[n]) ≈ g(ˆ[n|n − 1]) +
We denote the Jacobians by :

Now we use the linearized models :
+f(ˆ[n − 1|n − 1]) − A[n − 1]ˆ[n − 1|n − 1]
+g(ˆ[n|n − 1]) − H[n]ˆ[n|n − 1]
There are two diﬀerences with the standard Kalman ﬁlter :
A is now, time varying.
Both equations have known terms added to them. This will not change
the derivation of the Kalman ﬁlter.
The extended Kalman ﬁlter has exactly the same equations where A
is replaced with A[n − 1].
A[n − 1] and H[n] should be computed at each sampling time.
MSE matrices and Kalman gain can no longer be computed oﬀ line.
