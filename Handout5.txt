Key Points
The Closed-Loop Transfer Functions are the actual transfer
functions which determine the behaviour of a feedback system.
They relate signals around the loop (such as the plant input and
output) to external signals injected into the loop (such as
reference signals, disturbances and noise signals).
It is possible to infer much about the behaviour of the feedback
system from consideration of the Return Ratio alone.
The aim of using feedback is for the plant output y(t) to follow
the reference signal r (t) in the presence of uncertainty. A
persistent diﬀerence between the reference signal and the plant
output is called a steady state error. Steady-state errors can be
evaluated using the ﬁnal value theorem.
Many simple control problems can be solved using combinations
of proportional, derivative and integral action:
Proportional action is the basic type of feedback control, but it can
be diﬃcult to achieve good damping and small errors
simultaneously.
Derivative action can often be used to improve damping of the
closed-loop system.
Integral action can often be used to reduce steady-state errors.

Controlled
In principle, we could could choose a “desired” transfer function F (s)
and use K(s) = F (s)/G(s) to obtain
y(s) = G(s)
F (s)
r (s) = F (s)¯(s)
In practice, this will not work
– because it requires an exact model of the plant and that there be
no disturbances (i.e. no uncertainty).
Feedback is used to combat the eﬀects of uncertainty
For example:
Unknown parameters
Unknown equations
Unknown disturbances

y(s) = do (s) + G(s)
di (s) + K(s)¯(s)
e(s) = r (s) − y(s)
y(s) = do (s) + G(s) di (s) + K(s) r (s) − y(s)

5.2.2
The Closed-Loop Characteristic Equation and the
Closed-Loop Poles
Note: All the Closed-Loop Transfer Functions of the previous
section have the same denominator:
The Closed-Loop Poles (ie the poles of the closed-loop system, or
feedback system) are the zeros of this denominator.
For the feedback system of Figure 5.1, the Closed-Loop Poles are the
1 + G(s)K(s) = 0
Closed-Loop Characteristic Equation
(for Fig 5.1)
The closed-loop poles determine:
The stability of the closed-loop system.
Characteristics of the closed-loop system’s
transient response.(e.g. speed of response,
presence of any resonances etc)

i.e. the product of all the terms around loop, not including the −1 at
the summing junction. L(s) is called the Return Ratio of the loop (and
is also known as the Loop Transfer Function).
The Closed-Loop Characteristic Equation is then
1 + L(s) = 0
and the Closed-Loop Poles are the roots of this equation.
5.2.4
A note on the Return Ratio
b(s)
a(s)
Figure 5.3
With the switch in the position shown (i.e. open), the loop is open. We
then have
a(s) = H(s)G(s)K(s) × −b(s) = −H(s)G(s)K(s)b(s)
Formally, the Return Ratio of a loop is deﬁned as −1 times the product
of all the terms around the loop. In this case
L(s) = −1 × −H(s)G(s)K(s) = H(s)G(s)K(s)
Feedback control systems are often tested in this conﬁguration as a
ﬁnal check before “closing the loop” (i.e. ﬂicking the switch to the
closed position).
Note: In general, the block denoted here as H(s) could include ﬁlters
and other elements of the controller in addition to the sensor
dynamics. Furthermore, the block labelled K(s) could include actuator
dynamics in addition to the remainder of the designed dynamics of the
controller.
5.2.5 Sensitivity and Complementary Sensitivity
The Sensitivity and Complementary Sensitivity are two particularly
important closed-loop transfer functions. The following ﬁgure depicts
just one conﬁguration in which they appear.

5.3 Summary of notation
The system being controlled is often called the “plant”.
The control law is often called the “controller” ; sometimes it is
called the “compensator” or “phase compensator”.
The “demand” signal is often called the “reference” signal or
“command”, or (in the process industries) the “set-point”.
The “Return Ratio”, the “Loop transfer function” always refer to the
transfer function of the opened loop, that is the product of all the
transfer functions appearing in a standard negative feedback loop
(our L(s)). Figure 5.1 has L(s) = G(s)K(s), Figure 5.2 has
L(s) = H(s)G(s)K(s).
It characterizes the sensitivity of a control system to disturbances
The “Sensitivity function” is the transfer function S(s) =
appearing at the output of the plant.
is called the
“Complementary Sensitivity”. The name comes from the fact that
The transfer function T (s) =
S(s) + T (s) = 1. When this appears as the transfer function from
the demand to the controlled output, as in Fig 5.4 it is often called
simply the “Closed-loop transfer function” (though this is
ambiguous, as there are many closed-loop transfer functions).
5.4 The Final Value Theorem (revisited)
Consider an asymptotically stable system with impulse response g(t)
and transfer function G(s), i.e.
g(t)
Impulse response
Transfer Function
(assumed asymptotically stable)
y(t) =
note that
g(τ) dτ denote the step response of this system and
We now calculate the ﬁnal value of this step response:
lim y(t) =
g(τ) dτ
exp(−0τ) g(τ) dτ =
L g(t)
s=0 = G(0)
Hence,
Final Value of Step Response ≡
“Steady-State Gain”
evaluated at s = 0
or “DC gain”
Note that the same result can be obtained by using the Final Value
Theorem:
for any y for which
both limits exist.
lim y(t) = lim s y(s)
s→0
= G(0)
5.4.1
The “steady state” response – summary
The term “steady-state response” means two diﬀerent things,
depending on the input.
Given an asymptotically stable system with transfer function G(s):
The steady-state response of the system to a constant input U is a
constant, G(0)U.
The steady-state response of the system to a sinusoidal input
cos(ωt) is the sinusoid |G(jω)| cos ωt + arg G(jω) .
These two statements are not entirely unrelated, of course: The
steady-state gain of a system, G(0) is the same as the frequency
response evaluated at ω = 0 (i.e. the DC gain).
5.5 Some simple controller structures
5.5.1 Introduction – steady-state errors
Return Ratio: L(s) = G(s)K(s).
CLTFs: y(s) =
Steady-state error:(for a step demand) If r (t) = H(t), then
y(s) = 1+L(s) × 1 and so
1 + L(s) s
lim e(t) =
L(0)
1 + L(0)
Steady-state error
(using the ﬁnal-value theorem.)
Note: These particular formulae only hold for this simple conﬁguration
– where there is a unit step demand signal and no constant
disturbances (although the ﬁnal value theorem can always be used).
5.5.2
Proportional Control
K(s) = kp
Typical result of increasing the gain kp , (for control systems where
G(s) is itself stable):
Increased accuracy of control.
Increased control action.
Reduced damping.
Possible loss of closed-loop stability for large kp .
“bad”
Example:
G(s) =
(s + 1)2
(A critically damped 2nd order system)
kp G(s)
r (s) =
1 + kp G(s)
1 + kp
s + 2s + 1 + kp
So, ω2 = 1 + kp ,
2ζωn = 2
1 + kp , ζ =
Closed-loop poles at
s = −1 ± j kp
movement of
closed-loop poles
for increasing kp
”root locus diagram”
Steady-state errors using the ﬁnal value theorem:
y(s) = 2
r (s).
s + 2s + 1 + kp ﬁnal
value of
step response
So, if r (t) = H(t),
s 2 + 2s + 1 + kp
lim e(t) = 2
(Note: L(s) = kp
= L(0) = kp × 1 = kp )
Hence, in this example, increasing kp gives smaller steady-state
errors, but a larger and more oscillatory transient response .
• However, by using more complex controllers it is usually possible to
remove steady state errors and increase damping at the same time:
To increase damping –
can often use derivative action (or velocity feedback).
To remove steady-state errors –
can often use integral action.
For reference, the step response: (i.e. response to r (s) =
(2 + s)
) is given by
y(s) = − 2
y(t) = −
exp(−t) cos( kp t) +
1+kp exp(−t) cos( kp t − φ)
Transient Response
sin( kp t) +
Steady-state response
where φ = arctan √
But you don’t need to calculate this to draw the conclusions we have
made.
5.5.3 Proportional + Derivative (PD) Control
K(s) = kp + kd s
Typical result of increasing the gain kd , (when G(s) is itself stable):
Increased Damping.
Greater sensitivity to noise.
(It is usually better to measure the rate of change of the error directly
if possible – i.e. use velocity feedback)

2cωn = 2 + kd =
ωn = 1 + kp , c =
2 + kd
2 1 + kp
Xkp = 4, kd = 0
for increasing kd
5.5.4
Proportional + Integral (PI) Control
In the absence of disturbances, and for our simple conﬁguration,
steady-state error,
(for step demand)
1 + G(s)K(s) s=0
1 + G(0)K(0)
To remove the steady-state error, we need to make
(assuming G(0) ≠ 0).
K(0) = ∞
K(s) = kp + i
ki /s
K(s) = kp + ki /s
(kp + ki /s) 1 2
1 + (kp + ki /s)
kp s + ki
s(s + 1)2 + kp s + ki
s(s + 1)2
Hence, for r (t) = H(t),
s(s + 1)2 + kp s + ki s=0
no steady-state error
PI control – General Case
In fact, integral action (if stabilizing) always results in zero
steady-state error, in the presence of constant disturbances and
demands, as we shall now show.
Assume that the following system settles down to an equilibrium with
lim e(t) = A ≠ 0, then:
di (t)
do (t)
r (t)
e(t)
u(t)
“G(s)”
“ki /s”
“H(s)”
Contradiction
(as system is not in equilibrium)
Hence, with PI control the only equilibrium possible has
lim e(t) = 0.
provided the closed-loop
asymptotically stable.
That is, limt→∞ e(t) = 0
system is

5.5.5 Proportional + Integral + Derivative (PID) Control
K(s) = kp + i + kd s
Characteristic equation:
1 + G(s)(kp + kd s + ki /s) = 0
• can potentially combine the advantages of both derivative and
integral action:
but can be diﬃcult to “tune”.
There are many empirical rules for tuning PID controllers
(Ziegler-Nichols for example) but to get any further we really need
some more theory . . .
