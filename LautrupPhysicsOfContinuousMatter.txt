ÈÖ
Continuum physics is as old as science itself. The decision to write a textbook about this subject
has not been easy, because of the feeling that everything has been said and written before.
What prompted me to write this book was a one-semester course in which I had to teach the
basic principles of continuum physics to students of physics, geophysics and astrophysics. The
students had previously been taught mechanics and thermodynamics, and along with this course
on continuum physics they were also learning electromagnetism. There is a certain parallelism
in the use of partial differential equations in both of these subjects, but basically I could neither
assume they knew much about the mathematical methods nor the physics in advance. In the end
the book came to contain much more material than could be readily covered in one semester, but
its modular layout still makes it fairly easy to select a subset of topics that ﬁts the needs of a
particular course.
The book is ﬁrst and foremost an introduction to the basic ideas and the derivation of the
equations of continuum mechanics from Newtonian particle mechanics. The ﬁeld concept is
introduced from the very outset and tensors are used wherever they are necessary. There is no
call for shyness in this respect, here nearly 200 years after Cauchy. Although many examples—
in particular in the ﬁrst few chapters—are taken from geophysics and astrophysics, this does not
mean that the book is designed only for students of these subjects. All physics students ought to
be familiar with the description of the macroscopic world of apparently continuous matter.
Secondly, the necessary mathematical tools are developed along with the physics on a
‘need-to-know’ basis in order to avoid lengthy and boring mathematical preliminaries seemingly
without purpose. The disadvantage of this pedagogical line is of course that the general analytic
methods and physical principles, so important later in a physics student’s life, become scattered
throughout the book. I have attempted to counteract this tendency by structuring the text in
various ways and clearly marking out important results, sometimes repeating central material.
The three short appendices also help in this respect.
The important thing to learn from this book is how to reason about physics, both qualitatively
and—especially—quantitatively. Numerical simulations may be ﬁne for obtaining solutions to
practical problems, but are of very little aid in obtaining real understanding. Physicists must
learn to think in terms of fundamental principles and generic methods. Solving one problem
after another of similar kind seems unnecessary and wasteful. This does not mean that the
physicist should not be able to reach a practical result through calculation, but the physical
principles behind equations and the conditions underlying approximations must never be lost
sight of. Nevertheless, numerical methods are used and explained in some detail whenever it
seems natural, including two whole chapters on numeric simulation in elastostatics and ﬂuid
mechanics.
The book is divided into ﬁve parts; introduction, hydrostatics, deformable solids, basic ﬂuid

PREFACE
mechanics and special topics in ﬂuid mechanics. I have made no attempt to balance the space
allotted to ﬂuid and solid mechanics; ﬂuid mechanics clearly dominates the book because it is
after all conceptually simpler than even the linear mechanics of isotropic solids. Although there
may be a certain built-in logic in the way the fundamental equations of continuum physics are
derived and presented, the subject of applications is so rich that there can be no canonical order
of presentation. Apart from the bare-bone fundamentals, continuum physics appears as a huge
collection of interconnected topics, or ‘stories’. Any textbook of sufﬁciently broad scope is
therefore necessarily coloured by the interests, predilections and idiosyncracies of its author.
The book should be useful at several levels of teaching. In an introductory second year
course one would perhaps choose as curriculum chapters 1–5, 9–12 and 15–20. Later and
more advanced courses might wish to include most of the book. The level of difﬁculty is as
much as possible sought to rise steadily within each chapter and in the book as a whole. The
chapters are of fairly uniform length, and each chapter has a ‘soft’ introduction making contact
with everyday experience. Historical comments and microbiographies of the major players are
sprinkled throughout the text without any attempt at systematics or completeness. Whenever
feasible, the mutual interdependence of chapters has—at the cost of some repetition—been
reduced in order to facilitate the exclusion of whole chapters in a curriculum. Certain sections
and subsections have been marked with a star to indicate that they fall outside the main line of
presentation either in subject or in level of difﬁculty, and may require more teacher support or
simply be skipped in a ﬁrst reading.
As an aid to the text the book has been provided with a large number of marginal vignettes,
outlining the salient features of a physical system or a choice of coordinates. They are nothing but
the simpleminded sketches that we all draw—or should draw—when trying to learn new physics.
Larger ﬁgures are of course used whenever the margin turns out to be too narrow. At the end
of each chapter there is a collection of problems with answers outlined in the back of the book.
Some problems test the use of the formalism in practical settings, others the understanding of
the theoretical concepts, and still others develop the theory presented in the chapter further. The
system of units is as in any other modern text the international one (SI), although commonly used
units strictly speaking outside of this system, for example bar or atm for pressure, are sometimes
also employed, though never without a proper deﬁnition.
Writing this book over the course of several years I have beneﬁtted from advice and support of
many people of whom I can mention only a few. First among them are those that have dared to use
the earlier versions of the manuscript in their teaching; Tomas Bohr of the Technical University of
Denmark, Predrag Cvitanovic of Georgia Tech and Niels Kjær Nielsen of University of Southern
Denmark. For physics input, discussions, and criticism I also thank Anders Andersen, Luiza
Angheluta, Andy Jackson, Alex Lande, Morten Olesen, Laurette Tuckerman and all of the
students that have followed my course over the years. Special thanks go to Mogens Høgh Jensen
without whose generosity I would not have been able to sustain my expensive habit of buying
books. I am grateful to my institute and my colleagues for being patient with me, and ﬁnally I
could not have ﬁnished this book without the daily support of my wife Birthe Østerlund.
The book is written for adults with a serious intention to learn physics. I have selected for
the readers what I think are the interesting topics in continuum physics, and presented these as
pedagogically as I can without trying to cover everything encyclopedically. The list of literature
contains pointers to texts that deal with specialized subtopics; mostly the books that I have found
useful. I sincerely hope that my own joy in understanding and explaining the physics shines
through everywhere.

The everyday experience of the smoothness of matter is an illusion. Since the beginning of the twentieth
century it has been known with certainty that the material world is composed of microscopic atoms and
molecules, responsible for the macroscopic properties of ordinary matter. Long before the actual discovery
of molecules, chemists had inferred that something like molecules had to exist, even if they did not know
how big they were. Molecules are small—so small that their existence may be safely disregarded in all
our daily doings. Although everybody possessing a powerful microscope will note the irregular Brownian
motion of small particles in a liquid, it took quite some mental effort and a big conceptual jump from the
everyday manipulation of objects to recognize that this is a sign that molecules are really there.
Continuum physics deals with the systematic description of matter at length scales that are large
compared to the molecular scale. Most macroscopic length scales occurring in practice are actually huge
in molecular units, typically in the hundreds of millions. This enormous ratio of scales isolates continuum
theories of macroscopic phenomena from the details of the microscopic molecular world. There might, in
principle, be many different microscopic models leading to the same macroscopic physics.
This chapter paints in broad outline the transition from molecules to continuous matter, or
mathematically speaking from particles to ﬁelds. It is emphasized that the macroscopic continuum
description must necessarily be of statistical nature, but that random statistical ﬂuctuations are strongly
suppressed by the enormity of the number of molecules in any macroscopic material object. The central
theme of this book is the recasting of Newton’s laws for point particles into a systematic theory of
continuous matter, and the application of this theory to the wealth of exotic and everyday phenomena
of the macroscopic material world.

1.1 Molecules
The microscopic world impinges upon the macroscopic almost only through material constants
characterizing the interactions between macroscopic amounts of matter, such as coefﬁcients of elasticity
and viscosity. It is, of course, an important task for the physics of materials to derive the values of
these constants, but this task lies outside the realm of continuum physics. In continuum physics it is
nevertheless sometimes instructive to consider the underlying atomic or molecular structure in order to
obtain an understanding of the origin of macroscopic phenomena and of the limits to the macroscopic
continuum description.

Molecular weight
Chemical reactions such as 2H2 + O2 → 2H2 O are characterized by simple integer coefﬁcients. Two
measures of hydrogen plus one measure of oxygen yield two measures of water without anything left over
of the original ingredients. What are these measures? For gases at the same temperature and pressure, it is

simply the volume, so that for example two litres of hydrogen plus one litre of oxygen yield two litres of
water vapour, assuming that the water vapour without condensing can be brought to the same temperature
and pressure as the gases had before the reaction. In 1811, Count Avogadro of Italy proposed that the simple
integer coefﬁcients in chemical reactions between gases could be explained by the rule that equal volumes
of gases contain equal numbers of molecules (at the same temperature and pressure).
The various measures do not weigh the same. A litre of oxygen is roughly 16 times heavier than a
litre of hydrogen at the same temperature and pressure. The weight of a litre of water vapour must—of
course—be the sum of the weights of its ingredients, hydrogen and oxygen, and from the reaction formula
it now follows that this becomes roughly ((2 × 1) + (1 × 16))/2 = 9 times the weight of a litre of hydrogen.
Such considerations lead to the introduction of the concept of relative molecular weight or mass in the ratio
1:16:9 (or equivalently 2:32:18) for hydrogen, oxygen and water.
In the beginning there was no way of ﬁxing an absolute scale for molecular mass, because that would
require knowledge of the number of molecules in a macroscopic amount of a substance. Instead, a unit,
called a mole, was quite arbitrarily ﬁxed to be one gram of atomic hydrogen (H). This scale is practical for
the chemist at work in his laboratory, and the ratios of molecular masses obtained from chemical reactions
would then determine the mass of a mole of any other substance. Thus the molar mass of molecular
hydrogen (H2 ) is 2 grams and that of molecular oxygen (O2 ) 32 grams, whereas water has a molar mass of
((2 × 2) + (1 × 32))/2 = 18 grams. This system could be extended to all chemical reactions allowing the
determination of molar mass for any substance participating in such processes.

Avogadro’s number
We now know that chemical reactions actually describe microscopic interactions between individual
molecules built from atoms and that molecular mass is simply proportional to the mass of a molecule.
The constant of proportionality was called Avogadro’s number by Perrin, who in 1908 carried out the ﬁrst
modern determination of its value from Brownian motion experiments. Perrin’s experiments relying on
Einstein’s recent (1905) theory of Brownian motion were not only seen as a conﬁrmation of this theory

but also as the most direct evidence for the reality of atoms and molecules. Today, Avogadro’s number is
deﬁned to be the number of atoms in exactly 12 grams of the fundamental carbon isotope (12 C), and its
value is N A = 6.022137(3) × 1023 molecules per mole1 .

Molecular separation
Consider a substance with mass density ρ and molar mass Mmol . A mole of the substance occupies a
volume Mmol /ρ, and the volume per molecule becomes Mmol /ρ N A . A cube with this volume would have
sides of length
L mol =

Mmol 1/3
,

(1.1)

which may be called the scale of molecular separation. For iron we get L mol ≈ 0.24 nm, for water
L mol ≈ 0.31 nm, and for air at normal temperature and pressure L mol ≈ 3.4 nm. For liquids and solids,
where the molecules touch each other, this length is roughly the size of a molecule, whereas in gases it may
be much larger. There is a lot of vacuum in a gas, in fact about 1000 times the volume of matter at normal
temperature and pressure.

Molecular forces
Apart from the omnipresent gravitational interaction between all bodies, molecular interactions are entirely
electromagnetic in nature, from the fury of a tornado to the gentlest kiss. A deeper understanding of the
so-called van der Waals forces acting between neutral atoms and molecules requires quantum theory and
falls outside the scope of this book.
Generally, however, the forces between neutral atoms and molecules are short-ranged and barely reach
beyond nearest molecular neighbours. They are strongly repulsive if the atoms are forced closer than their
natural sizes allow and moderately attractive when they are moved apart a little distance, but farther away
they quickly die out. When two molecules are near each other, this tug of war between repulsion and
attraction leads to a minimum in the potential energy between the molecules. The state of matter depends,
broadly speaking, on the relation between the depth of this minimum, called the binding energy, and the
average kinetic energy due to the thermal motion of the molecules.

Solids, liquids and gases
In solid matter the minimum lies so deep that thermal motion cannot overcome the attraction. Each
individual atom or molecule is tied to its neighbours by largely elastic forces. The atoms constantly undergo
small-amplitude thermal motion around their equilibrium positions, but as long as the temperature is not so
high that the solid melts, they are bound to each other. If external forces are applied, solids may deform
elastically with increasing force, until they eventually become plastic or even fracture. Most of the work
done by external forces in deforming elastic solids can be recovered as work when the forces disappear.
In ﬂuid matter, liquids and gases, the minimum is so shallow that the thermal motion of the molecules
is capable of overcoming the attractive forces between them. The molecules effectively move freely around
between collisions, more so in gases than in liquids where molecular conglomerates may form. External
forces make ﬂuids ﬂow—in liquids a kind of continual fracturing—and a part of the work done by such
forces is dissipated into random molecular motion, heat which cannot directly be recovered as work when
the forces cease to act.

1.2 The continuum approximation
Whether a given number of molecules is large enough to warrant the use of a smooth continuum description
of matter depends on the precision desired. Since matter is never continuous at sufﬁciently high precision,
continuum physics is always an approximation. But as long as the ﬂuctuations in physical quantities
caused by the discreteness of matter are smaller than the desired precision, matter may be taken to be

continuous. Continuum physics is, like thermodynamics, a limit of statistical physics where all macroscopic
quantities such as mass density and pressure are understood as averages over essentially inﬁnite numbers
of microscopic molecular variables.
Luckily, it is only rarely necessary to exploit this connection. In a few cases, such as in the analysis
below, it is useful to look at the molecular underpinnings of continuum physics. In doing so, we shall use
the simplest ‘molecular’ description possible. A quite general meta-law of physics says that the physical
laws valid at one length scale are not very sensitive to the details of what happens at much smaller scales.
Without this law, physics would in fact be impossible, because we never know what lies below our currently
deepest level of understanding.

In a gas the molecules move
rapidly in and out of a small
volume with typical velocities of
the order of the speed of sound.

Suppose that we want to determine the mass density ρ = m N/V of a gas to a certain relative precision ,
say = 1%, by counting the number of identical molecules N of mass m in a small volume V . Due to
random motion of the gas molecules, the number N will ﬂuctuate and yield a different value if measured
again. For a typical ﬂuctuation N in N, the relative ﬂuctuation in density will be the same as in N, or
N.
ρ/ρ = N/N. If the relative density ﬂuctuation should be at most we must require that N
Provided the time between measurements is large compared to the time between molecular collisions, the
molecules in the volume V will all be replaced by other molecules, and become an essentially random
collection of molecules from the gas at large. In such a random sample the ﬂuctuation in the number is of

At a precision level of = 1%, the smallest volume under consideration should contain at least Nmicro ≈
104 molecules, and the linear dimension of such a volume will be greater than L micro ≈ 22L mol . For air
under normal conditions this comes to about 80 nm, while for liquids and solids it is an order of magnitude
smaller because of the smallness of L mol .
In liquids and especially in solids the molecules do not move around much but oscillate instead
randomly around more or less ﬁxed positions, and the density ﬂuctuations in a volume are mainly due
to molecules passing in and out of the surface. In problems 1.2 and 1.3 the ﬂuctuations are estimated for

a cube and a sphere, resulting in a microscopic length scale of roughly the same form as above, although
with an exponent of −1/2 instead of −2/3.

Mean free path
Another condition for obtaining a smooth continuum description, is that molecules should interact with
each other to ‘iron out’ strong differences in velocities. If there were no interactions, a molecule with a
given velocity would keep on moving with that velocity forever. In solids and liquids where the molecules
are closely packed, these interactions take place over a couple of molecular separation lengths and put no
further restriction on the microscopic length scale.
In gases there is a lot of vacuum and molecules move freely over long distances. The mean free path
between collisions may be estimated by considering a spherical molecule or atom of diameter d with its
centre tracing out a straight path through the gas. It will hit any other sphere of the same diameter within
a ‘striking’ distance d from the path, i.e. inside a cylinder of diameter 2d. Since there is on average one
molecule in each volume L 3 , the distance the original sphere has to move before being sure of hitting

another is on average, λ = L 3 /πd 2 . A more careful analysis leads to the following expression for the

with an extra factor 2 in the denominator.
For air at normal temperatures we ﬁnd λ ≈ 94 nm which is not much larger than the microscopic
length scale, L micro ≈ 80 nm (for = 1%). For dilute gases the mean free path is much larger than the
microscopic scale and sets the length scale for the smallest continuum volumes rather than L micro , unless
the desired relative precision is very small (see problem 1.5).

Macroscopic smoothness
A smooth continuum description demands that there should be no measurable variation in density between
neighbouring microscopic volumes. If L denotes the typical macroscopic length scale for signiﬁcant
variations in density, the relative change in density over the distance L micro will be of magnitude
ρ/ρ ≈ L micro /L. Demanding that the relative density change is smaller than the measurement precision
, we conclude that we must have L L macro where
ρ/ρ

L micro .

(1.4)

Any region in which the density varies by a signiﬁcant amount must be larger in size than L macro ; otherwise
the smooth continuum description breaks down. With = 1% we ﬁnd L macro ≈ 100L micro . For air under
normal conditions this is about 10 µm, while for solids it is an order of magnitude smaller.
Since interfaces between macroscopic bodies are usually much thinner than L macro , these regions of
space fall outside the smooth continuum description. In continuum physics interfaces appear instead as
surface discontinuities in the otherwise smooth macroscopic description of matter.
Both the micro and macro scales diverge for → 0, substantiating the claim that it is impossible
to maintain a continuum description to arbitrarily small relative precision. The smallness of both length
scales for ordinary matter and for reasonable relative precision shows that there is ample room for a smooth
continuum description of everyday phenomena. Nanophysics, however, straddles the border between the
continuum and particle descriptions of matter, resulting in a wealth of new phenomena outside the scope of
classical continuum physics.

Material particles
In continuum physics we shall generally permit ourselves to speak about material particles as the smallest
objects that may consistently be considered part of the continuum description within the required precision.
A material particle will always contain a large number of molecules but may in the continuum description
be thought of as inﬁnitesimal or point-like.

1. CONTINUOUS MATTER
Although we usually shall think of material particles as being similar in different types of matter, they
are in fact quite different. In solids, we may with some reservation think of solid particles as containing
a ﬁxed collection of molecules, whereas in liquids and especially in gases we should not forget that the
molecules making up a ﬂuid particle at a given instant will shortly be replaced by other molecules. If the
molecular composition of the material in the environment of a material particle has a slow spatial variation,
this incessant molecular game of ‘musical chairs’ may slowly change the composition of the material inside
the particle. Such diffusion processes driven by spatial variations in material properties lie at the very root
of ﬂuid mechanics. Even spatial variations in the average ﬂow velocity will drive momentum diffusion,
causing internal (viscous) friction in the ﬂuid.
In modern textbooks on continuum physics there has been a tendency to avoid introducing the
concept of a material particle. Instead these presentations rely on global conservation laws to deduce
the local continuum description—in the form of partial differential equations—by purely mathematical
means. Although quite elegant and apparently free of physical interpretation problems, such an approach
unfortunately obscures the conditions under which the local laws may be assumed to be valid.
In this book the concept of a material particle has been carefully introduced in the proper physical
context of measurement precision. This approach allows us, for example, to conclude that a differential
equation involving the density (or any other quantity) cannot be assumed to be physically meaningful at

local description may be interpreted as representing the laws valid for the motion of individual material
particles. To satisfy both points of view, the interpretation and equivalence of the local and global laws will
be carefully elucidated everywhere in this book.

1.3 Newtonian mechanics
Sir Isaac Newton (1642–1727).
English physicist and mathematician.
Founded classical mechanics on three famous laws
in his books ‘Philosophiae Naturaliz Principia Mathematica’
(1687). Newton developed calculus to solve the equations of
motion, and formulated theories
of optics and of chemistry. He
still stands as perhaps the greatest scientiﬁc genius of all time.

In Newtonian mechanics (see appendix A) the basic material object is a point particle with a ﬁxed mass m .
Newton’s second law is the fundamental equation of motion, and states that mass times acceleration equals
force. Mathematically, it is expressed as a second-order differential equation in time t ,
m

d2x
= f,
dt 2

(1.5)

where x the instantaneous position of the particle, and f the force acting on it. In chapter 2 we
shall introduce vector calculus to handle quantities like x and f in a systematic way, but for now any
understanding of the meaning of a vector will work ﬁne.
Since the force on any given particle can depend on the positions and velocities of the particle itself
and of other particles, as well as on external parameters, the dynamics of a collection of particles becomes
a web of coupled ordinary second-order differential equations in time. Even if macroscopic bodies are
huge collections of atoms and molecules, it is completely out of the question to solve the resulting web of
differential equations. In addition, there is the problem that molecular interactions are quantum mechanical
in nature, and Newtonian mechanics, strictly speaking, does not apply at the atomic level. This knowledge
is, however, relatively new and has as mentioned earlier some difﬁculty in making itself apparent at the
macroscopic level. So even if quantum mechanics rules the world of atoms, its special character is rarely
ampliﬁed to macroscopic proportions.

Global mechanical quantities
In Newtonian particle mechanics, a ‘body’ is taken to be a ﬁxed collection of point particles, each obeying
the second law (1.5). For any body one may deﬁne various global mechanical quantities which like the
total mass are calculated as sums over contributions from each and every particle in the body. Some of the
global quantities are kinematic: momentum, angular momentum, and kinetic energy. Others are dynamic:
force, moment of force, and power (rate of work of the forces).
Newton’s second law for particles leads to three simple laws of balance between the kinematic and
dynamic quantities;
• the rate of change of momentum equals force,
• the rate of change of angular momentum equals moment of force,

1.4. CONTINUUM PHYSICS
• the rate of change of kinetic energy equals power.
Even if these laws are insufﬁcient to determine the dynamics of a multiparticle body, they represent seven
individual constraints on the motion of any system of point particles, regardless of how complex it is. In
particular, they can be taken over to continuum mechanics when exchange of matter between a body and its
environment is properly taken into account.

1.4 Continuum physics
In continuum physics a macroscopic body is seen as a huge collection of tiny material particles, each of
which contains a sufﬁciently large number of molecules to justify a continuum description. Continuum
physics does not ‘on its own’ go below the level of the material particles. Although the mass density may
be calculated by adding together the masses of all the molecules in a material particle and dividing with the
volume occupied by it, this procedure falls, strictly speaking, outside continuum physics.

The ﬁeld concept
In the extreme mathematical limit, material particles are taken to be truly inﬁnitesimal and all physical
properties of the particles as well as the forces acting on them are described by smooth functions of space
and time. Continuum physics is therefore a theory of ﬁelds.
Mathematically, a ﬁeld f is simply a real-valued function f (x, y, z, t) of spatial coordinates x, y,
z and time t, representing the value of a physical quantity in this point of space at the given time, for
example the mass density ρ = ρ(x, y, z, t). Sometimes a collection of such functions is also called a ﬁeld
and the individual real-valued members are called its components. Thus, the most fundamental ﬁeld of
ﬂuid mechanics, the velocity ﬁeld v = (vx , v y , vz ), has three components, one for each of the coordinate
directions.
Besides ﬁelds characterizing the state of the material, such as mass density and velocity, it is convenient
to employ ﬁelds that characterize the forces acting on and within the material. The gravitational acceleration
ﬁeld g is a body force ﬁeld, which penetrates bodies from afar and acts on their mass. Some force ﬁelds
are only meaningful for regions of space where matter is actually present, as for example the pressure ﬁeld
p, which acts across the imagined contact surfaces that separate neighbouring volumes of a ﬂuid at rest.
Pressure is, however, not the only contact force. For ﬂuids in motion, for solids and more general materials,
contact forces are described by the nine-component stress ﬁeld, σ = {σi j }, which is a (3 × 3) matrix ﬁeld
with rows and columns labelled by coordinates: i, j = x, y, z.
Mass density, velocity, gravity, pressure and stress are the usual ﬁelds of continuum mechanics and will
all be properly introduced in the chapters to come. Some ﬁelds are thermodynamic, like the temperature T
and the speciﬁc internal energy density u. Others describe different states of matter, for example the electric
charge density ρe and current density j e together with the electric and magnetic ﬁeld strengths, E and B.
Like gravity g, these force ﬁelds are thought to exist in regions of space completely devoid of matter.
There are also ﬁelds that refer to material properties, for example the coefﬁcient of shear elasticity
µ of a solid and the coefﬁcient of shear viscosity η of a ﬂuid. Such ﬁelds are usually constant within
homogeneous bodies, i.e. independent of space and time, and are mostly viewed as material constants
rather than true ﬁelds.

Field equations
Like all physical variables, ﬁelds evolve with time according to dynamical laws, called ﬁeld equations. In
continuum mechanics, the central equation of motion descends directly from Newton’s second law applied
to every material particle. Mass conservation, which is all but trivial and most often tacitly incorporated in
particle mechanics, turns into an equation of motion for the mass density in continuum theory. Still other
ﬁeld equations such as Maxwell’s equations for the electromagnetic ﬁelds have completely different and
non-mechanical origins, although they do couple to the mechanical equations of motion.
Mathematically, ﬁeld equations are partial differential equations in both space and time. This makes
continuum mechanics considerably more difﬁcult than particle mechanics where the equations of motion are
ordinary differential equations in time. On the other hand, this greater degree of mathematical complexity
also leads to a plethora of new and sometimes quite unexpected phenomena.

1. CONTINUOUS MATTER
In some ﬁeld theories, for example Maxwell’s electromagnetism, the ﬁeld equations are linear in the
ﬁelds, but that is not the case in continuum mechanics. The nonlinearity of the ﬁeld equations of ﬂuid
mechanics adds a further layer of mathematical difﬁculty to this subject, making it very different from
linear theories. The nonlinearity leads to dynamic instabilities and gives rise to the chaotic and as yet not
fully understood phenomenon of turbulence, well known from our daily dealings with water and air.

Physical reality of force ﬁelds
Whereas the mass density only has meaning in regions actually containing matter, or may be deﬁned to
be zero in a vacuum, the gravitational ﬁeld is assumed to exist and take non-vanishing values even in the
vacuum. It speciﬁes the force that would be exerted on a unit mass particle at a given point, but the ﬁeld is
assumed to be there even if no particles are present.
In non-relativistic Newtonian physics, the gravitational ﬁeld has no independent physical meaning and
may be completely eliminated and replaced by non-local forces acting between material bodies. The true
physical objects appear to be the material bodies, and the gravitational ﬁeld just a mathematical convenience
for calculating the gravitational force exerted by these bodies. There are no independent dynamical
equations that tell us how the Newtonian ﬁeld of gravity changes with time. When material bodies move
around or change their mass distributions, their ﬁelds of gravity change instantaneously everywhere as they
move around.
In relativistic mechanics, on the other hand, ﬁelds take on a completely different meaning. The reason
is that instantaneous action-at-a-distance cannot take place. If matter is moved, the current view is that it
will take some time before the ﬁeld of gravity adjusts to the new positions, because no signal can travel
faster than light. Due to relativity, ﬁelds must travel independently, obey their own equations of motion,
and carry physical properties such as energy and momentum. Electromagnetic waves bringing radio and
TV signals to us are examples of force ﬁelds thus liberated from their origin. Gravitational waves have not
yet been observed directly, but indirectly they have been observed in binary neutron star systems which can
only be fully understood if gravitational radiation is taken into account.
Even if we shall not deal with relativistic theories of the continuum, and therefore may consider the
gravitational ﬁeld to be merely a mathematical convenience, it may nevertheless be wise, at least in the
back of our minds, to think of the ﬁeld of gravity as having an independent physical existence. Then we
shall have no philosophical problem endowing it with physical properties, even in matter-free regions of
space.

Is matter really discrete or continuous?
Although continuum physics is always an approximation to the underlying discrete atomic level, this is
not the end of the story. At a deeper level it turns out that matter is best described by another continuum
formalism, relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory, in which the discrete particles—electrons, protons, neutrons,
nuclei, atoms and everything else—arise as quantum excitations in the ﬁelds. Relativistic quantum ﬁeld
theory without gravitation emerged in the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century as the basic description of the
subatomic world, but in spite of its enormous success it is still not clear how to include gravity.
Just as the continuity of macroscopic matter is an illusion, the quantum ﬁeld continuum may itself one
day become replaced by even more fundamental discrete or continuous descriptions of space, time and
matter. It is by no means evident that there could not be a fundamental length in nature setting an ultimate
lower limit to distance and time, and theories of this kind have in fact been proposed2 . It appears that we
do not know, and perhaps will never know, whether matter at its deepest level is truly continuous or truly
discrete.

In classical Newtonian physics space is absolute and eternal, obeying the rules of Euclidean geometry
everywhere. It is the perfect stage on which all physical phenomena play out. Time is equally uniform and
absolute throughout space from beginning to end, and matter has no inﬂuence on the properties of space
and time. Rulers to measure length never stretch, clocks to measure time never lose a tick, and both can
be put to work anywhere from the deepest levels of matter to the farthest reaches of outer space. It is a
clockwork universe, orderly, rigorous and deterministic.
This semblance of perfection was shattered at the beginning of the twentieth century by the theories
of relativity and quantum mechanics. Space and time became totally intertwined with each other and with
matter, and the determinism of classical physics was replaced by the still disturbing quantum indeterminism.
Relativity and quantum mechanics are both theories of extremes. Although in principle they apply to the
bulk of all physical phenomena, their special features become dominant only at velocities approaching
the velocity of light in the case of relativity, or length scales approaching the size of atoms in the case of
quantum mechanics. Newtonian space and time remain a valid, if not ‘true’, conceptual framework over the
vast ranges of length and velocity scales covered by classical continuum physics.
In this chapter the basic ideas behind space and time are introduced in a way which emphasizes the
operational aspects of physical concepts. Care is exerted to ensure that the concepts deﬁned here should
remain valid in more advanced theories. A certain familiarity with Euclidean geometry in Cartesian
coordinates is assumed, and the chapter serves in most respects to deﬁne the mathematical notation to
be used in the remainder of the book. It may be sampled at leisure, as the need arises.

2.1 Reference frames
Physics is a quantitative discipline using mathematics to relate measurable quantities expressed in terms
of real numbers. In formulating the laws of nature, undeﬁned mathematical primitives—for example the
points, lines and circles of Euclidean geometry—are not particularly useful, and such concepts have for this
reason been eliminated and replaced by numerical representations everywhere in physics. This necessitates
a speciﬁcation of the practical procedures by which these numbers are obtained in an experiment; for
example, which units are being used.
Behind every law of nature and every formula in physics, there is a framework of procedural
descriptions, a reference frame, supplying an operational meaning to all physical quantities. Part of the art
of doing physics lies in comprehending this—often tacitly understood—infrastructure to the mathematical
formalism. The reference frame always involves physical objects—balances to measure mass, clocks to
measure time and rulers to measure length—that are not directly a part of the mathematical formalism.
Precisely because they are physical objects, they can at least in principle be handed over or copied, and
thereby shared among experimenters. This is what is really meant by the objectivity of physics.
The system of units, the Syst` me Internationale (SI), is today ﬁxed by international agreement. But even
e

2. SPACE AND TIME
if our common frame of reference is thus deﬁned by social convention, physics is nevertheless objective. In
principle our frames of reference could be shared with any other being in the universe.
The unit of mass, the kilogram, is (still) deﬁned by a prototype stored by the International Bureau of
Weights and Measures near Paris, France. Copies of this prototype and balances for weighing them
can be made to a precision of one part in 109 [34].

2.2 Time
Time is the number you read on your clock. There is no better deﬁnition. Clocks are physical objects
which may be shared, compared, copied and synchronized to create an objective meaning of time. Most
clocks, whether they are grandfather clocks with a swinging pendulum or oscillating quartz crystals, are
based on periodic physical systems that return to the same state again and again. Time intervals are simply
measured by counting periods. There are also aperiodic clocks, for example hour glasses, and clocks based
on radioactive elements. It is especially the latter that allow time to be measured on geological time scales.
Beyond such scales the concept of time becomes increasingly more theory-laden.
Like all macroscopic physical systems, clocks are subject to small ﬂuctuations in the way they run. The
most stable clocks are those that keep time best with respect to copies of themselves as well as with clocks
built on other principles. Grandfather clocks are much less stable than maritime chronometers that in turn
are less stable than quartz clocks. The international frame of reference for time is always based on the most
stable clocks currently available.
Formerly the unit of time, the second, was deﬁned as 1/86 400 of a mean solar day, but the Earth’s
rotation is not that stable, and since 1966 the second has been deﬁned by international agreement as
the duration of 9 192 631 770 oscillations of the microwave radiation absorbed in a certain hyperﬁne
transition in the cesium-133 atom. A beam of cesium-133 atoms is used to stabilize a quartz oscillator
at the right frequency by a resonance method, so what we call an atomic clock is really an atomically
stabilized quartz clock. The intrinsic relative precision in this time standard is about 4 × 10−14 , or
about one second in a million years [34].
In the extreme mathematical limit, time may be assumed to be a real number t, and in Newtonian physics
its value is assumed to be universally known.

2.3 Space
It is a mysterious and so far unexplained fact that physical space has three dimensions, which means that it
takes exactly three real numbers—say x1 , x2 and x3 —to locate a point in space. These numbers are called
the coordinates of the point, and the reference frame for coordinates is called the coordinate system. It must
contain all the operational speciﬁcations for locating a point given the coordinates, and conversely obtaining
the coordinates given the location. In this way we have relegated all philosophical questions regarding the
real nature of points and of space to the operational procedures contained in the reference frame.

Ö Ö
Ö

On Earth everybody navigates by means of a geographical system, in which a point is characterized
by latitude, longitude and height. The geographical coordinate system is based on agreed upon ﬁxed
points on Earth: the north pole, Greenwich in London, and the average sea level. The modern Global
Positioning System uses ‘ﬁxed’ points in the sky in the form of satellites, and the coordinates of any
point on Earth is determined from differences in the time-of-ﬂight of radio signals.
It is convenient to collect the coordinates x1 , x2 , and x3 of a point in a single object, a triplet of real numbers

a

x = (x1 , x2 , x3 ),

b

(2.1)

called the position of the point in the coordinate system1 . The triplet notation is just a notational
convenience, so a function of the position f (x) is completely equivalent to a function of the three
coordinates f (x1 , x2 , x3 ).
1 In almost all modern textbooks it is customary to use boldface notation for triplets of real numbers (‘vectors’) and
we shall also do so here. In calculations with pencil on paper many different notations are used to distinguish such a
symbol from other uses, for example a bar (x), an arrow (x) or underlining (x).

2.3. SPACE

15

There is nothing sacred about the names of the coordinates. In physics and especially in practical
calculations, the coordinate variables are often renamed x1 → x, x2 → y and x3 → z, so that the general
point becomes x → (x, y, z). It is also customary to write a = (ax , a y , az ) for a general triplet, with the
coordinate labels used as indices instead of 1, 2 and 3. It is of course of no importance whether the range
of indices is labelled x, y, z or 1, 2, or 3 or something else, as long as there are three of them.

Coordinate transformations
Having located a point by a set of coordinates x = (x1 , x2 , x3 ) in one coordinate system, the coordinates
x = (x1 , x2 , x3 ) of the exact same point in another coordinate system must be calculable from the ﬁrst

Ö Ö
Ö

x1 = f1 (x1 , x2 , x3 ),
x2 = f2 (x1 , x2 , x3 ),
x3 = f3 (x1 , x2 , x3 ).

a↔a

In triplet notation this is written
x = f (x).

(2.2)

This postulate reﬂects that physical reality is unique and that different coordinate systems are just different
ways of representing the same physical space in terms of real numbers. Conversely, each one-to-one
mapping of the coordinates deﬁnes another coordinate system. The study of coordinate transformations is
central to analytic geometry and permits characterization of geometric quantities by the way they transform
rather than in abstract terms (see section 2.7).

Length
From the earliest times humans have measured the length of a road between two points, say a and b, by
counting the number of steps it takes to walk along this road. In order to communicate to others the length
of a road, the count of steps must be accompanied by a clear deﬁnition of a step, for example in terms of an
agreed-upon unit of length.
Originally the units of length—inch, foot, span and fathom—were directly related to the human
body, but increasing precision in technology demanded better-deﬁned units. In 1793 the metre was
introduced as a ten millionth of the distance from equator to pole on Earth, and until far into the
twentieth century a unique ‘normal metre’ was stored in Paris, France. Later the metre became
deﬁned as a certain number of wavelengths of a certain spectral line in krypton-86, an isotope of a
noble gas which can be found anywhere on Earth (thereby eliminating the need for a trip to Paris!).
Since 1983 the metre has been deﬁned by international convention to be the distance travelled by
light in exactly 1/299 792 458 of a second [34]. The problem of measuring lengths has thus been
transferred to the problem of measuring time, which makes sense because the precision of the time
standard is at least a thousand times better than any proper length standard.
This method for determining length may be reﬁned to any desired practical precision by using very short
steps. In the extreme mathematical limit, the steps become inﬁnitesimally small, and the road becomes a
continuous path. The shortest such path is called a geodesic and represents the ‘straightest line’ between the
points. Airplanes and ships travel along geodesics, i.e. great circles on the spherical surface of the Earth.

Distance
The distance between two points is deﬁned to be the length of the shortest path between them. Since the
points are completely deﬁned by their coordinates, a and b relative to the chosen coordinate system, the
distance must be a real function d(a, b) of the two sets of coordinates. This function is not completely
general; certain axioms have to be fulﬁlled by any distance function (see problem 2.1).
From the deﬁnition it is clear that the distance between two points must be the same in all coordinate
systems, because it can, in principle, be determined by laying out rulers between points without any

where a = f (a) and b = f (b) are calculated by the coordinate transformation (2.2). Knowing the
distance function d(a, b) in one coordinate system, it may be calculated in any other coordinate system by
means of the appropriate coordinate transformation.
This expresses the invariance of the distance under all coordinate transformations. In the same way
as (2.2) may be viewed mathematically as a deﬁnition of what is meant by ‘another coordinate system’,
equation (2.3) may be viewed mathematically as a deﬁnition of what is meant by distance in the other
coordinate system.

Cartesian coordinate systems
It is another fundamental physical fact that it is possible (within limited regions of space and time) to
construct coordinate systems, in which the distance between any two points, a and b, is given by the
expression
d(a, b) =

(a1 − b1 )2 + (a2 − b2 )2 + (a3 − b3 )2 .

Such coordinate systems were ﬁrst analysed by Descartes and are called Cartesian. The distance function
implies that space is Euclidean and therefore has all the properties one learns about in elementary geometry.

Triplets of real numbers play a central role in everything that follows, and it is now convenient to introduce a
set of algebraic rules for these objects. We shall see below (section 2.8) that vectors in Cartesian coordinate
systems are triplets that transform in a special way under coordinate transformations.

Basic algebraic rules
The following operations endow triplets with the properties of the familiar geometric vectors. Visualization
on paper is of course as useful as ever, so we shall also draw triplets and illustrate their properties by means
of arrows.

Linear operations: Linear operations lie at the core of triplet algebra,
s a = (sa1 , sa2 , sa3 )

(addition),

(2.6)

a − b = (a1 − b1 , a2 − b2 , a3 − b3 )

(2.7)

These rules tell us that the set of all triplets, also called Ê3 , mathematically is a three-dimensional vector
space. A straight line with origin a and direction b is described by the linear function a + b s with
−∞ < s < ∞.

Bilinear products: There are three different bilinear products of triplets, of which the two ﬁrst are well
known from ordinary vector calculus,
a · b = a1 b1 + a2 b2 + a3 b3

Two triplets are said to be orthogonal when their dot product vanishes. Note that the cross product is deﬁned
entirely in terms of the coordinates and that we do not in the rule itself distinguish between left-handed and
right-handed coordinate systems. Whether you use your right or left hand when you draw a cross product
on paper does not matter for the triplet product rule, as long as you consistently use the same hand for all
such drawings.

column-matrix and a row-matrix, also called the direct product and sometimes in the older literature the
dyadic product. In section 2.8 we shall introduce more general geometric objects, called tensors, of which
the simplest are matrices of this kind. The tensor product, and tensors in general, cannot be given a simple

Besides the basic algebraic rules for triplets, a number of other deﬁnitions are useful in practical
calculations.

Volume product: The trilinear product of three triplets obtained by combining the cross product and
the dot product is called the volume product,
a × b · c = a1 b2 c3 + a2 b3 c1 + a3 b1 c2 − a1 b3 c2 − a2 b1 c3 − a3 b2 c1 .

2.6. INDEX NOTATION

19

2.6 Index notation
Triplet notation for vectors is sufﬁcient in most areas of physics, because physical quantities are mostly
scalars (i.e. single numbers like mass) or vectors such as velocity, but sometimes it is necessary to use a more
powerful and transparent notation which generalizes better to more complex expressions and quantities. It
is called index notation or tensor notation, and consists in all simplicity of writing out the coordinate indices
explicitly wherever they occur. Instead of thinking of a position as a triplet x, we think of it as the set of
coordinates xi with the index i running implicitly over the coordinate labels, i = 1, 2, 3 or i = x, y, z,
without having to state it every time.

Algebraic operations
Triplet and index notations coexist quite peacefully as witnessed by the linear operations
(sa)i = sai ,

(2.25)

(a + b)i = ai + bi ,

(2.26)

(a − b)i = ai − bi .

(2.27)

For the scalar product we let the sum range implicitly over the coordinate labels,
ai bi .

a·b=

(2.28)

i

In full-ﬂedged tensor calculus even the summation symbol is left out and understood as implicitly present
for all indices that occur precisely twice in a term. We shall, however, refrain from doing so here.

The Kronecker delta
The collection of nine scalar products of basis vectors has two indices that each run implicitly over the three
coordinate labels, and is written
ei · e j = δi j .

(2.29)

The expression δi j is the unit matrix in index notation,
δi j =

1 for i = j
,
0 otherwise

(2.30)

also called the Kronecker delta. This is the ﬁrst example of a true tensor of rank 2. Another is the tensor
product (2.10) of two vectors, which takes the form
(ab)i j = ai b j .

(2.31)

It is, in fact, not enough for a tensor just to have two (or more) indices, but it sufﬁces for now. In section
2.8 we shall see what really characterizes tensors.

The Levi-Civita symbol
The trilinear volume product (2.11) becomes a triple sum over indices,
i j k ai b j ck ,

Mostly we shall avoid this complicated notation, although it does come in handy in general discussions.

2.7 Cartesian coordinate transformations
The same Euclidean world may be described geometrically by different observers with different reference
frames. Each observer constructs his own preferred Cartesian coordinate system and determines all
positions relative to that. Every observer thinks that his basis vectors have the simple form (2.18) and
satisfy the same orthogonality and completeness relations. Every observer believes he is right-handed.
How can they ever agree on anything with such a self-centred view of the world?
The answer is—as indicated in section 2.3—that the two descriptions are related by a coordinate
transformation (2.2). Since the distance between any two points is independent of the coordinate system,
the shortest paths must coincide, and straight lines must be mapped onto straight lines by any Cartesian
coordinate transformation. Seen from one Cartesian coordinate system, which we shall call the ‘old’, the
axes of another Cartesian coordinate system, called the ‘new’, will therefore also appear to be straight lines
with a common origin. Furthermore, since the scalar product of two vectors can be expressed in terms of
the norm (problem 2.5), it must—like distance—be independent of the speciﬁc coordinate system, such
that the new axes will also appear to be orthogonal in the geometry of the old coordinate system. Different
observers will thus agree that their respective coordinate systems are indeed Cartesian.

Simple transformations
We begin the analysis of coordinate transformations with the familiar elementary transformations:
translation, rotation and reﬂection. These transformations are of the general form (2.2), expressing the
coordinates of a geometrical point in the new system as a function of the coordinates of the same point in
the old. The simple transformations are related to a special choice of coordinate axes, and similar simple
transformations may be deﬁned for other choices.

General transformations
Let the new Cartesian coordinate system be characterized (in the old) by its origin c and its three orthogonal
and normalized basis vectors a1 , a2 , and a3 , satisfying the usual relations,

a1 · a2 = a2 · a3 = a3 · a1 = 0

A position x = (x1 , x2 , x3 ) in the new coordinate system must then correspond to the (old) position,
x = c + x1 a1 + x2 a2 + x3 a3 .

(2.39)

The new coordinates are obtained by multiplying from the left with the new basis vectors and using
orthonormality (2.38)
x1 = a1 · (x − c) = a11 (x1 − c1 ) + a12 (x2 − c2 ) + a13 (x3 − c3 ),
x2 = a2 · (x − c) = a21 (x1 − c1 ) + a22 (x2 − c2 ) + a23 (x3 − c3 ),

2

x3 = a3 · (x − c) = a31 (x1 − c1 ) + a32 (x2 − c2 ) + a33 (x3 − c3 ),
where ai j = (ai ) j are the coordinates of the new basis vectors. This is the most general coordinate
transformation between any two Cartesian coordinate systems. It is not very difﬁcult to show that the most
general transformation may be composed from a sequence of simple transformations (problem 2.22).
Using index notation, the general coordinate transformation may be written,
xi =

ai j (x j − c j ).
j

(2.40)

It is characterized by the translation vector c = {ci } and the transformation matrix A = {ai j } with
ai j = (ai ) j having the new basis vectors as rows. In matrix notation the transformation becomes even
more compact4 ,
x = A · (x − c).

(2.41)

The transformation matrix for a simple translation along the x-axis (2.35) is just the unit matrix, A = 1 ,
whereas for a simple rotation around the z-axis (2.36) we obtain the non-trivial matrix,



sin φ 0
A = − sin φ cos φ 0 .

A simple reﬂection in the yz-plane (2.37) is characterized by a diagonal transformation matrix with
(−1, 1, 1) along the diagonal.

Orthogonality and completeness of the new basis
The orthogonality and completeness of the new basis vectors imply that
ai · a j = δi j ,
a1 a1 + a2 a2 + a3 a3 = 1 .

(2.43)
(2.44)

4 In ordinary mathematical matrix calculus one would not use the dot to indicate multiplication (nor to indicate a scalar
product), but this notation is quite natural for the three-dimensional vectors and matrices that we encounter so often in
physics.

In index notation these two relations take the form,

which in matrix notation become the usual conditions for the matrix to be orthogonal,
A · A = A · A = 1.

(2.46)

A
Here (A )i j = (a j )i = a j i is the transposed matrix having the new basis vectors as columns. Since
A −1 = A , the second of the above relations actually follows from the ﬁrst. Orthogonality of the basis
implies completeness.
The transposed matrix has the same determinant as the original matrix and the determinant of a product
of matrices is the product of the determinants. Calculating the determinant of (2.46) we obtain (det A )2 = 1,
or
det A = ±1.

(2.47)

The transformation matrices are thus divided into two completely separate classes, those with determinant
+1, called rotations or sometimes proper rotations, and those with determinant −1, generically called
reﬂections. Since the simple reﬂection (2.37) has determinant −1, all reﬂections may be composed of a
simple reﬂection followed by a rotation.

2.8 Scalars, vectors and tensors
Geometric quantities may be classiﬁed according to their behaviour under pure rotations. When you rotate
the coordinate system the world stays the same; it is only the way you describe it that changes. Some
geometrical quantities, for example the distance between two points, are unaffected by a rotation; others,
like the coordinates of your current position, will change.

Scalar quantities
A single quantity S is called a scalar, if it is invariant under rotation
S = S.

(2.48)

Thus the distance, the norm and the dot product are scalars. In physics the natural constants, material
constants, as well as mass and charge are scalars.

Vector quantities
Any triplet of quantities, V , is called a vector, if it transforms under rotation according to
Vi =

ai j V j ,
j

(2.49)

or equivalently in matrix form,
V = A · V.

(2.50)

In physics, velocity, acceleration, momentum, force, and many other quantities are vectors in this sense.
The coordinates x of a point may also be called a vector according to this deﬁnition, but this is only correct
in Cartesian coordinate systems, and would be very wrong in curvilinear coordinates or curved spaces.
The above deﬁnition of a vector demonstrates that triplets must have special transformation properties
to qualify as vectors. A triplet containing your weight, your height, and your age, is not a vector but a
collection of three scalars.

2.9. SCALAR, VECTOR AND TENSOR FIELDS

Tensor quantities
Using the vector transformation (2.49) the tensor product of two vectors V W is found to transform
according to the rule,



(V W )i j = Vi W j = 

aik Vk  
k

a j l Wl  =

aik a j l Vk Wl .
kl

In the last step we have reordered the sums into a convenient form.
More generally, any set of nine quantities arranged in a matrix


T11 T12 T13
T = {Ti j } =  T21 T22 T23 
T31 T32 T33

(2.51)

is called a tensor of rank 2, provided it obeys the transformation law,
Ti j =

aik a j l Tkl ,

(2.52)

kl

which in matrix form may be written,
T = A ·T ·A .

(2.53)

In physics, the moment of inertia of an extended body and the quadrupole moment of a charge distribution
are well-known tensors of second rank.
Tensors of higher rank may be constructed in a similar way. A tensor of rank r has r indices and is a
collection of 3r quantities that transform as the direct product of r vectors. We have so far only met one
third rank tensor, the Levi-Civita symbol (2.33) (see problem 2.24). When nothing else is said, a tensor is
always assumed to be of rank 2.

2.9 Scalar, vector and tensor ﬁelds
In continuum physics the basic quantities are functions of the spatial coordinates, called ﬁelds, which may
also be classiﬁed according to their behaviour under rotation. The transformation laws are quite similar to
the ones above, the only difference being that the coordinates of the spatial position must also transform.
For scalar, vector and tensor ﬁelds we thus have (with x = A · x),
S (x ) = S(x),

(2.54a)

V (x ) = A · V (x),

(2.54b)

T (x ) = A · T (x) · A .

(2.54c)

These deﬁnitions express that the new ﬁelds in the new position are obtained from the old ﬁelds in the old
position by transforming them according to their type. In the following chapters we shall meet a number of
such ﬁelds, such as the scalar mass density ﬁeld, the vector velocity ﬁeld and the tensor stress ﬁeld.

Gradient, divergence and curl
In Cartesian coordinates a special symbol is introduced for the triplet of spatial derivatives, called the
gradient operator or nabla,
∇=

∂

,
∂ x1 ∂ x2 ∂ x3

.

(2.55)

Apart from being a differential operator, ∇ acts in all respects as a vector (see problem 2.16).
When this operator acts on a scalar ﬁeld S(x) it creates a vector ﬁeld, called the gradient of S,
∇S = (∇1 S, ∇2 S, ∇3 S) =

where we for clarity have suppressed the explicit dependence on the spatial coordinates x. Similarly, by

Geometrically, an axial vector
has its geometric direction reversed under a reﬂection of the
coordinate system in the origin
because it has the same coordinates in the reﬂected system as in
the original.

Instead of a simple reﬂection in the yz-plane, we shall use a complete reﬂection of the coordinate system
through its origin,
x = −x.

(2.59)

Geometrically, the reﬂection in the origin may be viewed as a composite of three simple reﬂections along
the three coordinate axes, or as a simple reﬂection of a coordinate axis followed by a simple rotation through
π around the same axis.

Polar vectors: A vector which obeys the usual transformation equation (2.49) under rotation as well
as under reﬂection is called a polar vector. Under a reﬂection in the origin, the coordinates of a polar
vector change sign just like the coordinates of a point, i.e. V = −V . Since the coordinate axes all
reverse direction, the geometrical position in space of a polar vector is unchanged by a reﬂection of the
coordinate system and the vector may faithfully be represented by an arrow, also under reﬂection. In
physics, acceleration, force, velocity and momentum are all polar vectors.
Axial vectors: There is, however, another possibility. The cross product of two polar vectors, U =

V × W , behaves differently than a polar vector under a reﬂection. According to our rules for calculating
the cross product, which are the same in all coordinate systems, we ﬁnd
U = V × W = (−V ) × (−W ) = V × W = U,

(2.60)

without the expected change of sign. Since U behaves normally under rotation with determinant +1,
we conclude that the missing minus sign is associated with any transformation with determinant −1, in
other words with any reﬂection. Generalizing, we deﬁne an axial vector U as a set of three quantities,
transforming according to the rule
Ui = det A

ai j U j ,
j

(2.61)

under a Cartesian coordinate transformation. The extra determinant eliminates the overall sign change
otherwise associated with reﬂections in the origin. In physics, angular momentum, moment of force and
magnetic dipole moments are all axial vectors.
The basis vectors of the old coordinate system have the coordinates, ei = −ei , in the new (reﬂected)
coordinate system. Basis vectors are proper geometric quantities and always transform as polar vectors
5 In the older literature the gradient, divergence and curl are often denoted by ∇S = grad S, ∇ · V = div V and

∇ × V = curl V or ∇ × V = rotV . This notation is now all but obsolete.

PROBLEMS

under reﬂection. One may easily get confused by the fact that the new basis vectors in the new system have
(by deﬁnition) the same coordinates ei as the old basis vectors in the old system, but it would be a mistake
to take this to mean that the basis vectors are axial.
The geometric direction of an axial vector depends on what we choose to be right and left. It is for
this reason wrong to think of an axial vector as an arrow in space. Geometrically, it has magnitude
and direction, but not sense, meaning that the positive direction of an axial vector is not a geometric
property, but a property ﬁxed by convention which changes under a reﬂection of the coordinate
system. For consistency all humans (even the British) have agreed that one particular coordinate
system and all coordinate systems that are obtained from it by proper rotation are right-handed,
whereas coordinate systems that are related to this class by reﬂection are left-handed. We do not
know whether non-human aliens would have adopted the same convention, but should we ever meet
such beings we would be able to ﬁnd the correct transformation between our reference frames and
theirs.

Pseudo-scalars: The volume product of three polar vectors P = a · b × c is a scalar quantity which
changes sign under a reﬂection of the coordinate system because the cross product is an axial vector which
does not change sign. More generally a pseudo-scalar transforms like
P = det A P,

(2.62)

under an arbitrary rotation or reﬂection.
The sign of a pseudo-scalar is not absolute, but depends on the handedness of the coordinate system,
and thus on convention. One might think that physics had no use for such quantities, because after all
physics itself does not depend on coordinate systems, only its mathematical description does. Nevertheless,
magnetic charge, if it is ever found, would be pseudo-scalar, and more importantly some of the familiar
elementary particles, for example the pi-mesons, are described by pseudo-scalar ﬁelds.

Pseudo-tensors: Axial vectors are also called pseudo-vectors, and one may similarly deﬁne pseudotensors of higher rank. The Levi-Civita symbol is a pseudo-tensor of third rank (problem 2.24).

Classiﬁcation under translation
A true vector may always be viewed as the difference between two positions v = b− a, and is thus invariant
under a pure translation x → x = x − c. Such vectors are called proper. Triplets that transform as vectors
under rotations but change under translations, like the position x itself, are called improper. In physics
electric dipole moments are improper polar vectors, whereas angular momentum, moment of force, and
magnetic dipole moments are improper axial vectors.

The force of gravity determines to a large extent the way we live. It is certainly the force about which we
have the best intuitive understanding. We learn the hard way to rise against it as small children, to keep it
at bay as adults, only to be brought down by it in the end. A few people have experienced true absence of
gravity for longer periods of time in satellites orbiting the Earth or rockets coasting towards the Moon.
Newton gave us the theory of gravity and the mathematics to deal with it. In a world where things
only seem to get done by push and pull, man suddenly had to accept that the Earth could act on the distant
Moon—and the Moon back on Earth. After Newton everybody had to suppress a feeling of horror for action
at a distance and accept that gravity instantaneously could jump across the emptiness of space and tug at
distant bodies. It took more than two centuries and the genius of Einstein to undo this learning. There is no
action at a distance. As we understand it today, gravity is mediated by a ﬁeld which emerges from massive
bodies and in the manner of light takes time to travel through a distance. If the Sun were suddenly to blink
out of existence, it would take eight long minutes before daylight was switched off and the Earth set free in
space.
In this chapter we shall study the interplay between mass and the instantaneous Newtonian ﬁeld of
gravity, and derive the equations governing this ﬁeld and its interactions with matter. Some basic knowledge
of gravity is assumed in advance, and the presentation in this chapter aims mainly to develop elementary
aspects of ﬁeld theory in the comfortable environment of Newtonian gravity. More advanced concepts will
be developed in chapter 6.

3.1 Mass density
In the continuum approximation the mass density is a ﬁeld, ρ(x, t), assumed to exist everywhere in space
and at all times. If there is no mass in a region, the mass density simply vanishes. Knowing this ﬁeld, we
may calculate the mass of a material particle occupying a small volume d V around the point x at time t ,
d M = ρ(x, t) d V.

(3.1)

We shall permit ourselves to suppress the space and time variables and just write d M = ρ d V , whenever
such notation is unambiguous.
Although we usually think of the mass density ﬁeld as varying smoothly throughout space, it is
sometimes convenient to allow for discontinuous boundaries in material bodies (an example is shown in
ﬁgure 3.1 on page 31). Often these discontinuities are ‘real’ in the sense that the transition between different
materials may happen on the molecular scale, as for example at the interface between two solid bodies that
touch each other.
In section 1.2 we discussed the continuum approximation and concluded that there are two length
L3
scales, L micro and L macro , that depend on the measurement precision. If d V

The total mass in a volume is
obtained by integrating (‘summing’) over all material particles
in the volume. The integral sign
is in fact a stylized version of
the letter S (for ‘sum’).

Total mass and centre of mass
Mass density is a local quantity, deﬁned in every point of space. The total mass in a volume V is a global
quantity obtained mathematically by integrating the mass density over V ,
M=

V

dM =

V

ρ(x, t) d V.

(3.2)

Physically the integral should be understood as an approximation to a huge sum over the tiny, though not
truly inﬁnitesimal, material particles contained in the volume. If the density depends on time or if the
volume changes shape and size with time, the total mass may depend on time.
In continuum physics the material contained in any volume V may be viewed as a ‘body’, and the centre
of mass of such a body is naturally deﬁned from the average of the position x over all material particles,
xM =

1
1
x dM =
x ρ(x, t) d V.
M V
M V

(3.3)

In the Newtonian mechanics of particles and stiff bodies, the centre of mass of a body plays an important
role, because it moves like a point particle under the inﬂuence of the total force acting on the body (see
appendix A). Although this is also true in continuum mechanics, it is not nearly as useful because the shape
of a body may change drastically over longer time-spans. Think for example of a bucket of oil thrown into
a waterfall. It may not always be physically meaningful to speak about a well-deﬁned ‘body of oil’ at later
times.

Spherical systems
Planets like Earth or stars like the Sun are in the ﬁrst approximation spherically symmetric. Spherical
symmetry implies that the mass density ρ at any point x only depends on the distance r = | x − c| to the
centre c, which for symmetry reasons must also be the centre of mass. Usually the origin of the coordinate
system is chosen to be at the centre such that c = 0. For a simple spherical planet with radius a and constant
density ρ0 we have
ρ(r ) =

(3.4)

Such a distribution might be used for analytic calculations for a small rock planet like the Moon, but
deﬁnitely not for the Earth.
In ﬁgure 3.1 the mass density of the Earth is plotted (fully drawn) as a function of the central distance.
It cannot be measured directly, but is inferred from a combination of surface observations and modelling.
For analytic calculations, its mass distribution may be approximated by two layers of constant density,
ρ1 = 10.9 g cm−3 in the core and ρ2 = 4.4 g cm−3 in the mantle (see problem 3.7).

3.2 Gravitational acceleration
Galileo found empirically that all bodies fall in the same way, independent of their mass. In Newton’s
language this shows that the force of gravity on a body is proportional to its mass. For a material particle
of mass d M = ρd V the force of gravity may be written
d

= g(x, t) d M = ρ g d V,

(3.5)

where g(x, t) is called the gravitational acceleration ﬁeld, or just gravity. The last form shows that gravity
is a body force (also called a volume force) which acts everywhere in a body with a density of force
f = d /d V = ρ g . In ﬁgure 3.3 on page 35 the magnitude of Earth’s gravity is plotted as a function
of the distance from the centre of the Earth.

3.2. GRAVITATIONAL ACCELERATION

31

Figure 3.1. The mass density of the Earth as a function of distance r from the centre with the surface at
r = 6371 km (from the standard Earth model [41]). There is a sharp break in the density at the transition
between the iron core and the stone mantle at r = 3485 km, and a smaller break at r = 1216 km between
the outer liquid iron core and the inner solid iron core. The broken lines indicate the average densities in
mantle and core.

In Newtonian physics the gravitational ﬁeld imparts a common acceleration to all bodies. Given
the same initial conditions all material bodies will follow the same orbits in a gravitational ﬁeld.
As a consequence there is no way we can distinguish between gravitational forces and the inertial
(so-called ﬁctitious) forces experienced in accelerated motion. The identical behaviour of all bodies
in a ﬁeld of gravity allows one to look upon the gravitational ﬁeld as a property of space and time,
rather than simply a vehicle for gravitational interaction. The indistinguishability of gravity and
acceleration was raised to a fundamental law, the Principle of Equivalence, by Einstein in his General
Theory of Relativity from 1915, in which gravity reﬂects the geometric curvature of space and time
[78].

Total gravitational force and total moment of gravity
The ﬁeld of gravity speciﬁes the gravitational acceleration at every point of space and every instant of time.
The total gravitational force on a body of volume V , the weight of the body, is
=

V

ρ g d V.

(3.6)

The total force determines how the body as a whole moves. It is independent of the choice of origin of the
coordinate system, but depends like any other vector on its orientation. If ρ, g, or V change in the course
of time, the total force may also change.
The total moment of force of gravity relative to the coordinate origin is

Å=

V

x × ρ g d V.

(3.7)

The total moment determines how a body as a whole rotates around the origin. The moment depends not
only on the orientation of the coordinate system, but also on its origin. It is an improper axial vector. In a
translated coordinate system with origin in x = c, the coordinates are x = x − c, and the moment becomes

Field lines follow the instantaneous ﬁeld everywhere. They are
very different from the orbits particles would follow through the
ﬁeld. A thrown stone follows a
parabolic orbit as it falls to the
ground, whereas the ﬁeld lines on
the surface of the Earth are vertical.

At the surface of Earth, gravity is very close to being constant with magnitude equal to the standard
gravity, deﬁned by convention to be exactly g0 = 9.80665 m s−2 with no uncertainty. The actual
gravitational acceleration at the surface of the Earth depends on many factors, for example local mass
concentrations and the positions of the Moon and Sun (see ﬁgure 7.1 on page 90). The gravitational
acceleration has been determined with a relative precision of 3 × 10−9 in an experiment using
atom interferometry [56]. Galileo’s law was veriﬁed in the same experiment to within 7 × 10−9 by
comparing the measured values of the gravitational acceleration for a macroscopic body and for a
cesium atom, in effect a modern version of his famous ‘leaning tower of Pisa’ experiment.
The moment of force may be expressed in terms of the centre of mass (3.3),

Å=

V

x × ρ g0 d V =

V

ρ x dV

× g0 = x M × M g 0 .

(3.10)

This shows that in constant gravity, the total moment is the same as that of a point particle with mass equal
to the total mass of the body, situated at the centre of mass. In a constant gravitational ﬁeld, the moment of
gravity calculated in a coordinate system with origin at the centre of mass must vanish because x M = 0 in
these coordinates. The moment of force in constant gravity is important for understanding the stability of
ﬂoating bodies (chapter 5).

Visualizing the gravitational ﬁeld
A visual impression of the gravitational ﬁeld may be given by a picture of the ﬁeld lines, deﬁned to be
families of curves that at a given instant t0 have the gravitational ﬁeld as tangent (see ﬁgure 3.2). This
means that the curves are solutions to the ﬁrst-order differential equation
dx
= g( x, t0 ),
ds

(3.11)

where s is a running parameter along the curve. This parameter is not the time, but has dimension of
time squared because g has dimension of length per unit of time squared. The solutions are of the form
x = x(s, x 0 , t0 ) with x 0 being the starting point at s = 0. The ﬁeld lines form an instantaneous picture of
the ﬁeld at time t0 , and cannot be directly related to particle orbits, as illustrated by the nearly circular orbit
of a planet which is everywhere orthogonal to the ﬁeld lines.
Field lines have the very important property that they can never cross. For if two ﬁeld lines crossed in
a point x, then by (3.11) there would have to be two different values of the gravitational ﬁeld at the same
point, and that is impossible (except when the ﬁeld vanishes, as it does in one point of ﬁgure 3.2). As will
be shown in the following section, all gravitational ﬁeld lines have to come in from inﬁnity and end on
masses, and we shall also see that ﬁeld lines do not form closed loops.

3.3 Sources of gravity
The gravitational ﬁeld tells us how gravity acts on material bodies. But what generates the gravitational
ﬁeld? What is its source? The answer is—as most people are aware—that the ﬁeld is generated by mass.

3.3. SOURCES OF GRAVITY

Figure 3.2. The gravitational ﬁeld (and some nearly circular equipotential surfaces) between Earth and
Moon. You should imagine rotating this picture around the Earth–Moon axis. The drawing is to scale,
except for two regions of 10 times the sizes of the Earth and the Moon that have been cut out for technical
reasons. The ﬁeld lines are plotted everywhere with a density proportional to the ﬁeld strength. The numbers
on the frame are coordinates centred on Earth in units of 1000 km. The Moon appears to have a streaming
‘mane of hair’ because all the ﬁeld lines ending on its surface have to come in from spatial inﬁnity and
cannot cross the lines of Earth’s ﬁeld.
Quantitatively this is expressed by Newton’s law of gravity which says that the ﬁeld from a point particle of
mass M at the origin of the coordinate system is
g(x) = −G M

x
,
|x|3

(3.12)

where G is the universal gravitational constant. The negative sign asserts that gravitation is always
attractive, or equivalently that ﬁeld lines always run towards masses. The last factor shows that the strength
of gravity decreases with the inverse square of the distance.
The gravitational constant is hard to determine to high precision. The recommended [52] 1998
value, G = 6.673(10) × 10−11 N m2 kg−2 , has an embarrassingly large uncertainty of more than
one part in 103 . The inverse square law has been well tested at planetary distances during the
last centuries, but only recently at the submillimetre scale (see, for example Long et al , Nature
421, (2003) 922). The force of gravity is terribly weak compared to other forces. In the hydrogen
atom the ratio of the force of gravity to the electrostatic force (between electron and proton) is
4.4 × 10−40 . The only reason gravity can be observed at all is the nearly complete electric neutrality
of macroscopic bodies. Electrostatic and ‘gravistatic’ forces seem superﬁcially alike in that they are
both inversely proportional to the square of the distance (which gives them inﬁnite range; they are, in
fact, the only fundamental forces in nature with inﬁnite range). But where electric charge can be both
positive and negative, mass is always positive, implying that there are no ‘neutral’ bodies unaffected
by gravity, nor bodies that are repelled by the gravity of other bodies (antigravity). Gravity and
electromagnetism are in fact very different at a deeper level, only completely revealed in General
Relativity.
Another basic property of gravity is that it is additive, so that matter—also from the point of view of
its gravity—may be viewed as a collection of material particles of mass d M = ρ d V , each contributing its
own little point-like ﬁeld to the total. Using (3.12) but shifting the position of the source particle from the

(3.13)

Note that the integrand has a singularity at x = x (when ρ(x) = 0). This singularity is, however,
integrable and creates no problem (except problem 3.8).

Forces between extended bodies
The expression for the ﬁeld (3.13) brings us full circle. We are now able to calculate the gravitational ﬁeld
from a mass distribution, as well as the force that this ﬁeld exerts on another mass distribution, even on
itself. Substituting the ﬁeld (3.13) into the force (3.6), and renaming the integration variables, the total
force by which a mass distribution ρ2 in the volume V2 acts on a mass distribution ρ1 in V1 becomes,
12 = −G

V1

(3.14)

Newton’s third law is fulﬁlled, 12 = − 21 , because the integrand is antisymmetric under exchange of
1 ↔ 2 due to the ﬁrst factor. Consequently, the force from a mass distribution acting on itself vanishes, as
it ought to. For if this self-force did not vanish a body could, so to speak, lift itself by its bootstraps.

Asymptotic behaviour
The gravitational ﬁeld from the matter contained in a volume of ﬁnite extent has a particularly simple form
at large distances. Since x then only ranges over a ﬁnite region in (3.13), it follows for | x| → ∞ that

Taking this expression outside the integral we obtain

| x|3

,

(3.15)

where M is the total mass. At sufﬁciently large distances the ﬁeld of an arbitrary spatially bounded mass
distribution always approaches that of a point particle containing the total mass of the body.

Field of a spherical body
The mass distribution ρ(r ) of a spherically symmetric body is only a function of the distance r = | x| from
its centre, which here is taken to be at the origin of the coordinate system. Since gravity according to (3.13)
is caused by the mass distribution, it should also be spherically symmetric. For a vector ﬁeld this means
that it is everywhere directed radially away from the centre,
g( x) = g(r ) er ,

(3.16)

where er = x/r is the radial unit vector and g(r ) is a function of r alone. In ﬁgure 3.3 the value of −g(r )
is plotted for the Earth as a function of the radial distance. One notes the surprising fact that the strength of
gravity is actually larger (by about 10%) inside Earth’s mantle than on the surface.
In chapter 6 we shall see that spherical gravity takes an extremely simple form. We shall prove that the
ﬁeld strength g(r ) is everywhere—inside and outside the distribution—equal to the ﬁeld of a point particle
situated at the centre of the distribution,

Figure 3.3. The strength of gravity −g(r ) inside and outside the Earth as a function of distance from the
centre. The solid curve is obtained from the standard Earth data [41]. The strength of gravity grows roughly
linearly from the centre to the core/mantle boundary at r = 3485 km, and decreases slightly in the mantle
due to the sharp drop in mass density at the boundary. The dotted dropping line is the core ﬁeld itself. The
dashed lines are obtained from the two-layer model of the Earth (problem 3.7).

The strength of gravity grows linearly with r inside the planet because the total mass grows with the third
power of r whereas the ﬁeld strength decreases with the second power.
It follows from (3.18) that for every point in the vacuum outside a spherical mass distribution where
M(r ) equals the total mass, the ﬁeld (3.17) is exactly the same as that of a point particle at the centre with
mass equal to the total mass of the body. We have seen above that the ﬁeld at great distances from an
arbitrary body is always approximately that of a point particle, but now we learn that the ﬁeld is of this
form everywhere around a perfectly spherical body. There are no near-ﬁeld corrections to the gravitational
ﬁeld of a spherical body. Without this wonderful property, Newton could never have related the strength
of gravity at the surface of the Earth—iconized by the fall of an apple—to the strength of gravity in the
Moon’s orbit.

3.4 Gravitational potential
Although the ﬁeld of gravity is a vector ﬁeld with three components, there is really only one functional
degree of freedom underlying the ﬁeld, namely the mass distribution giving rise to it. The relationship
between these two ﬁelds expressed by (3.13) is, however, non-local, meaning that g(x) in a point x depends
on a physical quantity ρ(x ) in points x that may be arbitrarily far away.

3. GRAVITY

Figure 3.4. The gravitational potential − (r ) of the Earth as a function of distance from the centre. The
fully drawn curve is obtained by numerically integrating the standard Earth data [41]. The dotted curve is
the potential of the core alone, and the dashed curve is obtained from the two-layer model (problem 3.7).
The vertical dashed lines indicate the positions of the sharp transitions in the mass density (see ﬁgure 3.1),
which have completely disappeared from view in this plot.

Gravity as a gradient ﬁeld
We shall now prove that the acceleration ﬁeld can be derived locally from a single scalar ﬁeld
the gravitational potential. The relation between the acceleration ﬁeld and the potential is,
g = −∇ ,

( x), called

(3.20)

with a conventional minus sign in front. The gradient operator (nabla) has been deﬁned in equation (2.55).
Because of the gradient, the potential is deﬁned only up to an undetermined additive constant.
In order to demonstrate (3.20) we ﬁrst calculate the gradient of the central distance (see also problem
2.9)
∇| x| = ∇ x 2 =

apart from the arbitrary additive constant which we here choose so that the potential vanishes at spatial

(x) = −G

|x − x |

(3.24)

Since the mass density is always positive, the gravitational potential is always negative, a direct consequence
of the attractive nature of gravity and the normalization to zero potential at inﬁnity.
Even if the mass distribution may jump discontinuously, the gravitational ﬁeld will always be
continuous (as is evident from ﬁgure 3.3), because of the integration over the mass distribution in (3.13)

or (3.18). The potential is still smoother, because its deﬁnition (3.20) requires it to have a continuous
derivative. This is also borne out by ﬁgure 3.4 which shows the potential of the Earth as a function of
central distance. Almost all traces of the original discontinuities have vanished from sight.
The gravitational potential may be visualized by means of surfaces of constant potential, also called
equipotential surfaces. The ﬁeld lines are always orthogonal to the equipotential surfaces, and if they
are plotted with constant potential difference, the strength of the ﬁeld will be inversely proportional to the
distances between them. A few equipotential surfaces have been shown in the Earth–Moon plot in ﬁgure 3.2
on page 33.

Asymptotic behaviour
For a mass distribution of ﬁnite extent, the denominator will for |x| → ∞ become independent of x , so
that
(x) → −G

M
|x|

(3.25)

where M is the total mass, in complete accordance with (3.15). At large distances the potential of a ﬁnite
body thus approaches that of a point mass carrying the total mass of the body (see, however, problems 3.14
and 3.15).

The ﬂat-Earth limit
For a constant gravitational ﬁeld g(x) = g 0 we may take
(x) = −x · g 0 .

(3.26)

This seems to be at variance with expression (3.24) and certainly does not vanish at inﬁnity. Constant
gravitational ﬁelds should, however, always be understood as an approximation valid within limited regions
of space and time, and then the difﬁculty disappears.
For length scales much smaller than the radius of the Earth, the surface of the sea may be considered to
be ﬂat and the gravitational ﬁeld constant. In a ﬂat-Earth coordinate system with the z-axis vertical and the
sea level at z = 0, we may take g 0 = (0, 0, −g0 ) and ﬁnd
= g0 z.

(3.27)

The gravitational acceleration in the z-direction becomes gz = −∂ /∂z = −g0 and points downwards
everywhere, as it should be.

The potential of a spherical mass distribution can only depend on r = |x|. Using ∇ (r ) = (d (r )/dr ) ∇r
and ∇r = x/ |x| = er , we ﬁnd by comparison with (3.16)
g(r ) = −

d (r )

The ﬁnal expression is not quite as pretty as (3.17) because of the second term, which is necessary to secure
the continuity of the derivative of (r ). Outside the mass distribution the second term vanishes, and the
potential becomes, as expected, that of a point particle carrying the total mass of the body.

3.5 Potential energy
According to the laws of elementary particle mechanics, work is calculated from the product of a force and
the distance it moves a particle. It is important to make completely clear who does work on whom. When
a particle falls freely in a gravitational ﬁeld, it is the force of gravity which performs work on the particle
while the particle follows the path of its natural motion and gains kinetic energy. If we want the particle to
follow any other path, we must ‘by hand’ cancel the force of gravity with an equal and opposite force, and
slowly move the particle along the desired path.
For so-called conservative forces, the work we perform on the particle while moving it along the path
depends only on its end points and not on where the path goes between the end points. The work we must
perform in moving the particle from a ﬁxed position to any desired point x in space is only a function of
the end point x of the path. This function, V (x), is called the potential energy of the particle at the point x
because it represents the work that a particle at x would potentially perform on us, should we move it back
to the ﬁxed position.

Working against gravity
Suppose we move a point particle of mass m from position x 1 to x 2 along a path P in a static ﬁeld of
gravity, g(x). To keep the particle on this path, we must provide an external force −m g to counter gravity.
The work performed by us on the particle while moving it along the curved path is the sum of all the tiny
contributions −m g · d from each little path element d , and the total work we perform becomes a line
integral,
W =−

In the last expression the line integral along the path x(s) from x 1 = x(s1 ) to x 2 = x(s2 ) has been made
explicit by means of a running parameter s varying in the interval s1 ≤ s ≤ s2 along the path.
Because the ﬁeld of gravity is the gradient of the gravitational potential, the line integral may be carried
out. Inserting (3.20) we ﬁnd

Since this result is independent of the actual path of the particle, it follows that the gravitational potential
energy of the particle is m (x), and that the gravitational potential (x) is the potential energy per unit of
mass.

Escape velocity
The total energy of a point particle at x with velocity v is the sum of its kinetic energy and its potential
energy, (1/2)mv 2 + m (x). From elementary mechanics we know that the total energy is conserved, i.e.
constant in time. In other words, a particle starting in the point x 0 with velocity v 0 must at all times obey
the equation

PROBLEMS

39

Taking x 0 at inﬁnity, where the potential vanishes, it follows immediately that in order to escape the grip of
gravity with |v 0 | > 0 from a point x with potential , an object at x must be given a velocity that is larger
than
√
(3.36)
vesc = −2 .
Knowing the potential at a point is simply equivalent to knowing the escape velocity from that point.
A particularly interesting case occurs when the potential becomes so deep that the escape velocity
equals or surpasses the velocity of light c. In that case the body has turned into a black hole. Using
the potential of a point mass (3.23) we ﬁnd that this happens when the radius a of a spherical mass
distribution satisﬁes
a<

2G M
.
c2

(3.37)

Being a non-relativistic calculation this is of course highly suspect, but accidentally it is exactly the
same as the correct condition obtained in general relativity [49], where the right-hand side is called
the Schwarzchild radius. For the Earth the Schwarzchild radius is about a centimetre, and for the
Sun three kilometres.

No closed loops of gravity
For a closed path, C, which begins at the same point as it ends, the line integral must vanish
g·d =0

C

(3.38)

because the potential is the same at the end points of the path. This implies that there can be no closed loops
of ﬁeld lines. For if there were, the product g · d would have the same sign all around the loop, because
the tangent of a ﬁeld line is everywhere proportional to the ﬁeld, i.e. d ∼ g, and such an integral cannot
vanish.
Conversely, if the line integral of a ﬁeld g around any closed curve vanishes, the ﬁeld must be a gradient
ﬁeld. To prove this consider the line integral along some path P(x) connecting a ﬁxed point, say the origin
0, with an arbitrary point x,
(x) = −

P(x)

g(x ) · d .

(3.39)

This function only depends on the end point x and not on the path because two different paths, P and P ,
connecting the same points form a closed curve C = P − P , and by (3.38)

C

g·d =

g · d = 0.

(3.40)

Finally, we must show that (3.39) has the gradient g. Using the additivity of line integrals we get,

Since the left-hand side is

(x) = −

x+δx
x

g(x ) · d

≈ −g(x) · δx.

(x +δx)− (x) ≈ ∇ ·δx, and since δx is arbitrary, it follows that ∇

Fluids at rest

ÈÖ ××ÙÖ
If the Sun did not shine, if no heat were generated inside the Earth and no energy radiated into space, all the
winds in the air and the currents in the sea would die away, and the air and water on the planet would in the
end come to rest in equilibrium with gravity. In the absence of external driving forces or time-dependent
boundary conditions, and in the presence of dissipative contact forces, any ﬂuid must eventually reach a
state of hydrostatic equilibrium, where nothing moves anymore and all ﬁelds become constant in time. This
state must be the ﬁrst approximation to the sea, the atmosphere, the interior of a planet or a star.
In a continuous system in mechanical equilibrium there is everywhere a balance between contact forces
having zero range and body forces with inﬁnite range. Contact interactions between material bodies or even
between parts of the same body take place across contact surfaces. A contact force acting on a tiny piece
of a surface may in principle take any direction relative to the surface, but can of course be resolved into its
normal and tangential components. The normal component is called a pressure force and the tangential a
shear force. Solids and ﬂuids in motion can sustain shear forces, whereas ﬂuids at rest can not.
In this chapter we shall establish the basic concepts and formalism for pressure in hydrostatic
equilibrium and apply it to the sea and the atmosphere. Along the way we shall recapitulate some basic rules
of thermodynamics. In the following three chapters we shall continue the study of hydrostatic equilibrium
for ﬁsh, icebergs and ships, the interior of planets and stars, and the shapes of large and small ﬂuid bodies.

4.1 The concept of pressure
A ﬂuid at rest can as mentioned only sustain pressure forces. If shear forces arise, the ﬂuid will ﬂow
towards a new equilibrium without shear. This expresses the most basic property of ﬂuids and may be
taken as a deﬁnition of what constitutes a ﬂuid at the macroscopic level. In this section we shall take a ﬁrst
look at pressure deﬁned as force per unit of area, discuss its microscopic origins, and analyse a couple of
elementary cases.
The SI unit of pressure is pascal (Pa = N m−2 = kg m−1 s−2 ), but often pressure is quoted in units
of bars where 1 bar = 105 Pa or in atmospheres where 1 atm = 1.01325 bar is close to the average
air pressure at sea level. Modern meteorologists are now abandoning these units and tend to quote
air pressure in hectopascals (hPa) rather than in millibars.

Microscopic origin of pressure
In a liquid the molecules touch each other and the containing solid walls. The number of molecules that
are in direct contact with a small area A of a wall is proportional to the size of this area, and so is the total
normal force that the molecules collectively exert on the area. The pressure deﬁned as the normal force
per unit of area, p = /A, is thus independent of the size of the small area.

ÈÈÈ
ÈÈÈ
In Bernoulli’s model a molecule
moves in any of the six possible
directions along three orthogonal
directions with equal probability.

A gas consists mostly of vacuum with the molecules moving freely around between collisions, and the
pressure on a solid wall arises in this case from the incessant molecular bombardment. We shall estimate
the pressure using a simple ‘molecular’ model of a gas going back to Daniel Bernoulli, in which molecules
of mass m are only allowed to move back and forth along three orthogonal directions with a ﬁxed velocity
v . When a molecule hits a wall orthogonal to one of these directions, it is reﬂected directly back again and
transfers a momentum 2mv to the wall. Assuming that all six directions of motion are equally probable, the
number of molecules hitting an area A of the wall in a small time interval dt will be d N = 1/6ρ Av dt/ m ,
such that the total momentum transfer to the area in the time dt becomes d È = 2mv d N = 1/3ρ Av 2 dt .
The normal force exerted on the area equals the rate of momentum transfer, = d È /dt = 1/3ρ Av 2 , and
dividing by the area we obtain the pressure,

In the kinetic theory of gases one ﬁnds the same result, except that v is replaced by the root-mean-square
average of the molecular velocities, v =

Example 4.1.1 (Molecular velocity): At normal pressure, p = 1 atm, and temperature, T = 18 ◦ C =
291 K, the density of air is ρ ≈ 1.2 kg m−3 . The molecular velocity calculated from the above
expression becomes v ≈ 500 m s−1 . We shall see later that this velocity is related to the velocity
of sound.

A column of sea water. The pressure difference between bottom
and top must carry the weight of
the water in the box.

So far we have only deﬁned the external pressure acting on the walls of a container. Is it meaningful to
speak about pressure in the middle of a ﬂuid away from containing walls? We could of course insert a tiny
manometer to measure the pressure, but then we would just obtain the external pressure acting on another
wall, the surface of the manometer. There seems to be no simple way to determine directly what one would
call the true internal pressure in the ﬂuid.
Cutting through these ‘philosophical’ difﬁculties we shall simply postulate that there is indeed a welldeﬁned pressure ﬁeld p(x) everywhere in the ﬂuid and that it acts along the normal to any surface in the
ﬂuid, whether it be a real interface or an imagined cut through the ﬂuid. This postulate is supported by the
microscopic view of continuous matter. In a liquid we may deﬁne the internal pressure as the total force
per unit of area exerted by the molecules at one side of the cut on the molecules at the other side. Similarly,
in a gas the internal pressure may be deﬁned by the rate of molecular momentum transfer per unit of area
across the cut. In solids internal pressure is more subtle (see chapter 9).

Incompressible sea
Consider now a vertical box with cross-sectional area A and height h in a sea with constant density
ρ(x) = ρ0 . In hydrostatic equilibrium the difference between the pressure forces p A at the bottom and
p0 A at the top must balance the total weight of the water in the box, or
p A − p0 A = ρ0 Ahg0 ,

where g0 is the constant gravitational acceleration. If this equation were not fulﬁlled, the total force on
the column of water would not vanish, and it would have to move. Dividing by the area A, the pressure
difference between bottom and top of the box becomes,

p = p0 − ρ0 g0 z,

(4.4)

where p0 is the surface pressure. The linear rise of the pressure with depth −z allows us to immediately
calculate the total pressure force on the horizontal and vertical sides of a container. Skew or curved container
walls require a more powerful formalism which we shall soon set up.

4.2. FORMAL DEFINITION OF PRESSURE

47

Using ρ0 ≈ 1000 kg m−3 and g0 ≈ 10 m s−2 , the scale of the pressure increase per unit of depth
in the sea becomes ρ0 g0 ≈ 104 Pa m−1 , or about 1 atm/10 m. At the deepest point in the sea,
z ≈ −11 km, the pressure is a little more than 1000 atm. The assumption of constant gravity is well
justiﬁed even to this depth, because it changes only by about 0.35%, whereas the density of water
changes by about 4.5% (see page 54).

Because the pressure rises linearly with depth, this result could have been calculated without an explicit
integral. The total force is simply the product of the area of the sluice gate Lh with the average pressure
excess p − p0 = 1/2ρ0 g0 h acting on the gate.

Example 4.1.2 (Sluice gate force): Water is stemmed up to height h behind a sluice gate of width L.
On the water surface and on the outer side of the gate there is atmospheric pressure p0 . On the inside
of the gate the pressure is p(z) = p0 + ρ0 g0 (h − z), so that the total force on the gate becomes

h
p0

Water stemmed up behind a
sluice gate. The pressure varies
linearly with height z from the
bottom.

Incompressible atmosphere?
Since air is compressible, it makes little sense to use expression (4.4) for the pressure in a ﬂuid with constant
density (except for very small values of z). If we do so anyway, we ﬁnd a pressure which falls linearly with
height and reaches zero at a height,
z = h0 =

p0
.
ρ0 g0

(4.6)

Using p0 = 1 atm and air density ρ0 = 1.2 kg/m3 we get h 0 = 8.6 km, which is a tiny bit lower than
the height of Mount Everest. This is, of course, meaningless, since climbers have reached the summit of
that mountain without oxygen masks. But as we shall see, this height sets nevertheless the correct scale for
major changes in the atmospheric properties.

Paradox of hydrostatics
The linear rise of water pressure with depth may, as we have seen, be used to calculate the total pressure
force on any vertical container wall. For a curved container wall, like that of a vase or a boot, there seems
to be no problem, except handling the necessary mathematics. But if the water column does not reach all
the way to the surface, as when you ﬁll a boot with water, what is then the pressure at the ﬂat horizontal
bottom? Will it be constant along the bottom as in the open sea, or will it vary? And if it is constant, what
is it ‘up against’, since there is only a short column of water above?
The quick answer to this paradox is that the pressure is indeed constant along the horizontal bottom.
For if the pressure were lower in the ‘toe’ than in the ‘heel’, there would be unbalanced horizontal pressure
forces directed towards the toe acting on a horizontal box of water. But that is not allowed in complete
mechanical equilibrium. The only possible conclusion is that the material of the boot must supply the
necessary forces to compensate for the missing weight of the water column.

4.2 Formal deﬁnition of pressure
To establish a concise mathematical formalism for pressure we consider a surface S that divides a body into
two parts. This surface need not be a real surface where material properties change dramatically but may
just be an imaginary surface separating two parts of the same body from each other. A tiny surface element
is characterized by its area d S and the direction of its normal n. It is convenient to combine these in the
vector surface element
d S = (d Sx , d S y , d Sz ) = n d S.

(4.7)

There is nothing intrinsic in a surface which deﬁnes the orientation of the normal, i.e. whether the normal
is really n and not −n. A choice must, however, be made, and having done that, one may call the side

Paradox: the pressure along the
vertical wall of the ‘boot’ rises
linearly because it has to carry
the weight of the water above, but
what about the pressure in the tip

of the surface element into which the normal points, positive (and the other, of course, negative). Usually
neighbouring surface elements are required to be oriented consistently, i.e. with the same positive sides. By
universal convention the normal of a closed surface is chosen to be directed out of the enclosed volume, so
that the enclosed volume always lies at the negative side of its surface.

Local and global pressure force
The contact forces due to microscopic molecular interactions have a ﬁnite range at the molecular scale, but
zero range at macroscopic distances. Across a tiny but still macroscopic piece of surface, the number of
neighbouring molecules participating in the interaction as well as the force they exert may for this reason be
expected to be proportional to the area of the surface. In a ﬂuid at rest the only contact force is the pressure
force acting along the normal to the surface, and the force exerted by the material situated at the positive
side of a surface element on the material at the negative side must be of the form

with a coefﬁcient of proportionality p called the pressure. Convention dictates that a positive pressure
exerts a force directed towards the material on the negative side, and this explains the minus sign.

This is the force which acts on the cork in the champagne bottle, moves the pistons in the cylinders of your
car engine, breaks a dam, and ﬁres a bullet from a gun. It is also this force that lifts ﬁsh, ships, and balloons
and thereby cancels their weight so that they are able to ﬂoat (see chapter 5).

Same pressure in all directions?
Newton’s third law guarantees that the material on the negative side of a surface element reacts with an
equal and opposite force, −d = − p (−d S), on the material on the positive side (provided there is no
surface tension). Since the surface vector seen from the negative side is −d S, the above relation shows
that the pressure also has the value p on the negative side of the surface. This is part of a much stronger
result, called Pascal’s law, which we shall prove below: the pressure in a ﬂuid at rest is independent of the
direction of the surface element on which it acts. It implies that pressure p(x) cannot depend on the normal
n, but only on the location x of a surface element, and is therefore a true scalar ﬁeld.
The simple reason for pressure being the same in all directions in hydrostatic equilibrium is that the
pressure acts on the surface of a body whereas a body force by deﬁnition acts on the volume. If we let the
body shrink, the contribution from the body force will vanish faster than the contribution from the surface
force because the volume vanishes faster than the surface area. In the limit of vanishing body size only
the surface force is left, but it must then itself vanish in hydrostatic equilibrium where the total force on all
parts of a body has to vanish. This argument will now be ﬂeshed out in mathematical detail.

shall then show that for physical reasons this assumption cannot be maintained. Consider a tiny body in the
shape of a tetrahedron with three sides parallel to the coordinate planes. The total pressure force acting on
the body is
d

= − pd S − px d S x − p y d S y − pz d Sz ,

(4.10)

where we have denoted the pressures acting on the different faces of the tetrahedron by p, px , p y , and
pz and the outwards pointing normals by d S, d S x , d S y , and d Sz . It is sufﬁcient to consider inﬁnitesimal
bodies of this kind, because an arbitrary body shape can be put together from these. Each of the three
triangles making up the sides of the tetrahedron is in fact the projection of the front face onto that plane. By
elementary geometry the areas of the three projected triangles are d Sx , d S y and d Sz , so that their vector
surface elements become d S x = (−d Sx , 0, 0), d S y = (0, −d S y , 0), and d Sz = (0, 0, −d Sz ).

Inserting this in the above equation we ﬁnd the total force
d

= (( px − p)d Sx , ( p y − p)d S y , ( pz − p)d Sz ).

(4.11)

In hydrostatic equilibrium, which is all that we are concerned with here, the contact forces must balance
body forces,
+ f d V = 0,

d

(4.12)

where f is the density of body forces.
The idea is now to show that for sufﬁciently small tetrahedrons the body forces can be neglected and
the surface forces d must consequently vanish. Consider a geometrically congruent tetrahedron with all
lengths scaled by a factor λ. Since the volume scales as the third power of λ whereas the surface areas only
scale as the second power, the hydrostatic equation for the scaled tetrahedron becomes λ2 d +λ3 f d V = 0
or d + λ f d V = 0. In the limit of λ → 0 it follows that the total contact force must vanish, i.e. d = 0,
and using (4.11) we ﬁnd,
px = p y = pz = p.

(4.13)

As promised, the pressure must indeed be the same in all directions.

4.3 Hydrostatic equilibrium
In section 4.1 we intuitively used that in a ﬂuid at rest the weight of a vertical column of ﬂuid should equal
the difference in pressure forces between the bottom and the top of the column. We shall now generalize
this to an arbitrary macroscopic volume of ﬂuid, often called a control volume. The material in a control
volume, ﬂuid or solid or whatever, represents the most general ‘body’ that can be constructed in continuum
physics.
Up to this point we have studied only two kinds of forces that may act on the material in a control
volume. One is a body force described by a force density ﬁeld f caused by long-range interactions, for
example gravity f = ρ g. The other is a contact force, here the pressure ﬁeld p, which has zero range and
only acts on the surface of the control volume. The total force on the control volume V with surface S is
the sum of two contributions
=

V

f dV −

p d S.

(4.14)

S

The ﬁrst term is for the case of gravity just the weight of the ﬂuid in the volume and the second is the
so-called buoyancy force. The circle in the symbol for the surface integral is only there to remind us that
the surface is closed.

Global hydrostatic equilibrium equation
In hydrostatic equilibrium, the total force must vanish for any volume of ﬂuid,

V

f dV −

S

p d S = 0.

= 0, or
(4.15)

This is the equation of global hydrostatic equilibrium, which states that buoyancy must exactly balance the
total volume force, i.e. the weight. If the cancellation is not exact, as for example when a small volume
of water is heated or cooled relative to its surroundings, the ﬂuid must start to move, either upwards if the
buoyancy force is larger than the weight or downwards if it is smaller.
The problem with the global equilibrium equation is that we have to know the ﬁelds f (x) and p(x) in
advance to calculate the integrals. Sometimes symmetry considerations can get us a long way. In constant
gravity, the sea on the ﬂat Earth ought to have the same properties for all x and y, suggesting that the
pressure p = p(z) can only depend on the depth z. This was, in fact, a tacit assumption used in calculating
the pressure in the incompressible sea (4.4), and it is not difﬁcult to formally derive the same result from
the equation of global equilibrium (4.15). But, in general, we need to establish a local form of the equations
of hydrostatic equilibrium, valid at each point x.

A material particle is like any other body subject to pressure from all sides, but being inﬁnitesimal it is
possible to derive a general expression for the resultant force. Let us choose a material particle in the shape
of a small rectangular box with sides d x, d y, and dz, and thus a volume d V = d xd ydz. Since the pressure
p(x + d x) is slightly different on opposite sides of the box the resultant pressure force is to leading approximation (in
the x-direction)

Including the other coordinate directions we obtain

d

(4.16)

The result of all pressure forces acting on a tiny material particle is apparently equivalent to a volume force
with a density equal to the negative gradient of the pressure. We shall see below that this result does not
depend on the shape of the material particle.
If there is also a true volume force, f , for example gravity ( f = ρ g), acting on the material, the total
force on a material particle may be written,
= f ∗ d V,

(4.17)

f ∗ = f − ∇ p,

(4.18)

d
where

is called the effective force density. It must be emphasized that the effective force density is not a true body
force, but an expression which for a tiny material particle equals the sum of the true body force and all
pressure forces acting on its surface.

Local hydrostatic equilibrium
In hydrostatic equilibrium, the total force on an arbitrary body has to vanish. Applying this to all of the
material particles in the body, it follows that the effective density of force must vanish everywhere,
f ∗ = f − ∇ p = 0.

(4.19)

This is the local equation of hydrostatic equilibrium. It is a differential equation valid everywhere in a ﬂuid
at rest, and it encapsulates in an elegant way all the physics of hydrostatics.

The ﬂat-Earth case
Returning to the case of constant gravity in a ﬂat-earth coordinate system we have f = ρ g 0 = ρ(0, 0, −g0 )
and the local equilibrium equation takes the following form when written out explicitly in coordinates,
∂p
= 0,

∂p
= 0,
∂y

(4.20a)
(4.20b)
(4.20c)

The two ﬁrst equations show that the pressure does not depend on x and y but only on z, which conﬁrms
the previous argument based on symmetry. It also resolves the hydrostatic paradox because we now know
that independently of the shape of the container the pressure will always be the same at a given depth in
constant gravity. For the special case of constant density, ρ(z) = ρ0 , the last equation may immediately be
integrated to yield the previous result (4.4) for the pressure in the incompressible sea.

4.3. HYDROSTATIC EQUILIBRIUM

51

Constant density
More generally, if the density of the ﬂuid is constant, ρ = ρ0 , and the body force is due to gravity,
f = ρ0 g = −ρ0 ∇ , the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium (4.19) takes the form −∇(ρ0 + p) = 0,
which implies that the quantity,
H=

+

p
,
ρ0

(4.21)

is a constant, independent of x. The ﬁrst term is the gravitational potential and the second term is naturally
called the pressure potential. There is no agreement in the literature about a name for H , but one might call
it the effective potential, because the effective density of force becomes f ∗ = ρ0 g − ∇ p = −ρ0 ∇ H . It is
also related to the thermodynamic enthalpy.
The constancy of H contains the complete solution of the hydrostatic equation. In constant gravity we
thus have = g0 z and recover immediately the pressure in the sea (4.4) with H = p0 /ρ0 .

Gauss’ theorem
The equation of local equilibrium (4.19) has been obtained by applying the global equilibrium equation
(4.15) to a tiny material particle. Is it also possible to go the other way and derive the global equation from
the local?
The answer to the question is afﬁrmative, because of a purely mathematical theorem due to Gauss (to
be proved below), which in its simplest form states that

S

p dS =

V

∇ p d V,

(4.22)

for an arbitrary function p(x). Using Gauss’ theorem it follows immediately that the total force (4.14)
equals the integral of the effective density of force,

and complex analysis. In physics
he developed the magnetometer.
The older (cgs) unit of magnetic
strength is named after him.

(4.23)

V

This equivalence allows us to think of a macroscopic volume of ﬂuid as composed of microscopic material
particles acted upon by the effective force density f ∗ .
Gauss’ theorem is a fortiori also valid for a tiny material particle, where the total pressure force
becomes,

S

p dS =

V

∇ p d V ≈ ∇ p V.

This conﬁrms that the force on a material particle is indeed independent of its shape as long as the pressure
gradient is essentially constant across the particle.

∗ Proof of Gauss’ theorem: To prove Gauss’ theorem, consider ﬁrst a volume V described by the
inequalities a(x, y) ≤ z ≤ b(x, y) where a(x, y) and b(x, y) are two functions deﬁned in some area A of
the x y-plane. We then ﬁnd,

It is intuitively rather clear that a general volume may be cut up into pieces of this kind. Adding the surface
integrals the contributions from the mutual interfaces between neighbouring pieces will cancel each other
in the sum, leaving only the integral over the outermost surface of the total volume on the left-hand side.
Similarly the volume integrals add up to a volume integral over the total volume of all the pieces. Gauss’
theorem thus holds in full generality.

4. PRESSURE

∗ What about non-gradient forces?
The local equation of hydrostatic equilibrium, f = ∇ p, demands that the force density must equal a
gradient ﬁeld, and thus have a vanishing curl ∇ × f = 0 (see problem 2.15). A material with constant
density, ρ = ρ0 , has a gravitational force density f = ρ0 g = −ρ0 ∇ which is evidently a gradient ﬁeld.
But what happens if a force has a manifestly non-vanishing curl? As an example one can take f = a × x ,
which has ∇ × f = 2 a. Then the only possible conclusion is that hydrostatic equilibrium cannot be
established, and the ﬂuid must start to move. A physical example of this phenomenon is an electrically
charged ﬂuid with a magnetic ﬁeld that everywhere increases linearly with time. Such a magnetic ﬁeld
induces a static electric ﬁeld with non-vanishing curl, which indeed accelerates the charged molecules, and
thereby the ﬂuid.

4.4 Equation of state
The local equation of hydrostatic equilibrium is not enough in itself, but needs a relation between density
and pressure. In the examples of the preceding section we assumed that the ﬂuid was incompressible with
constant density and could then integrate the hydrostatic equation and determine the pressure.
Ordinary thermodynamics [11, 35] provides us with a relationship between density ρ , pressure p, and
absolute temperature T , called the equation of state, which may be written in many equivalent ways, for
example
f (ρ, p, T ) = 0.

(4.24)

In continuum physics the equation of state should be understood as a local relation, valid at every point x ,
f (ρ( x), p( x), T ( x)) = 0.

´
Benoit Paul Emile Clapeyron
(1799–1864). French engineer
and physicist. Formulated the
ideal gas law from previous work
by Boyle, Mariotte, Charles,
Gay-Lussac, and others. Contributed to early thermodynamics by building on Carnot’s work.
Deﬁned the concept of reversible
transformations and formulated
the ﬁrst version of the Second
Law of Thermodynamics. Established what is now called Clapeyron’s formula for the latent heat
in the change of state of a pure
substance.

(4.25)

As usual we shall suppress the explicit dependence on x when it does not lead to ambiguity. The actual form
of the equation of state for a particular substance is derived from the properties of molecular interactions, a
subject that falls outside the scope of this book.

The ideal gas law
The oldest and most famous equation of state is the ideal gas law, credited to Clapeyron (1834) and usually
presented in the form,
p V = n R T.

(4.26)

Here n is the number of moles of gas in a small volume V , and R = 8.31451(6) J K−1 mol−1 is the molar
gas constant. This equation of state has played an enormous role in the development of thermodynamics,
and an ideal gas is still the best ‘laboratory’ for understanding materials with a non-trivial thermodynamics.
In appendix C the thermodynamics of ideal gases is recapitulated in some detail.
Using that ρ = M/V = n Mmol /V , where M is the mass of the gas in V and Mmol its molar mass, we
obtain the ideal gas law in a form more suited for continuum physics,
p
RT
.
=

Mmol

(4.27)

The ideal gas law is not only valid for pure gases but also for mixtures of pure gases provided one uses the
molar average of the molar mass of the mixture (see problem C.1). Real air with Mmol = 28.9635 g/cm3
is quite well described by the ideal gas law, although in precise calculations it may be necessary to include
nonlinear corrections as well as corrections due to humidity [34].

4.5 Barotropic ﬂuid states
The problem with the equation of state (4.24) is, however, that it is not a simple relation between density
and pressure which may be plugged into the equation of local hydrostatic equilibrium, but also involves

4.5. BAROTROPIC FLUID STATES

53

temperature. To solve the general problem we need a further equation connecting temperature, pressure
and density. Such a heat equation is also provided by thermodynamics, and we shall derive it in chapter
30.

Barotropic relationship
At this stage it is, however, best to avoid these complications and for simplicity assume that there exists a
so-called barotropic relationship between pressure and density,
p = p(ρ)

or

ρ = ρ( p).

(4.28)

The assumption of a barotropic relationship is not as far-fetched as it might seem at ﬁrst. The condition of
constant density ρ(x) = ρ0 which we used in the preceding section to calculate the pressure in the sea is a
trivial example of such a relationship in which the density is independent of the pressure.
A less trivial example is obtained if the walls containing a ﬂuid at rest are held at a ﬁxed temperature T0 .
The omnipresent heat conduction will eventually cause all of the ﬂuid to attain this temperature, T (x) = T0 ,
and in this state of isothermal equilibrium the equation of state (4.25) simpliﬁes to,
f (ρ(x), p(x), T0 ) = 0

(4.29)

which is indeed a barotropic relationship.

Isothermal atmosphere
Everybody knows that the atmosphere is not at constant temperature, but if we nevertheless assume it to be,
we obtain by combining the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium (4.20) with the ideal gas law (4.27),
g
dp
M
= −ρg0 = − mol 0 p.
dz
RT0

(4.30)

With the initial condition p = p0 for z = 0, this ordinary differential equation has the solution
p = p0 e−z/ h 0 ,

(4.31)

where
h0 =

RT0
p
= 0 .
Mmol g0
ρ0 g0

(4.32)

In the last step we have again used the ideal gas law at z = 0 to show that the expression for h 0 is identical
to the incompressible scale height (4.6).
In the isothermal atmosphere the pressure thus decreases exponentially with height on a characteristic
length scale again set by h 0 . Now the pressure at h = h 0 = 8.6 km (roughly the top of Mount Everest) is
ﬁnite and predicted to be e−1 = 37% of the pressure at sea level, or 373 hPa.

Bulk modulus
The archetypal thermodynamics experiment is carried out on a ﬁxed amount M = ρV of a ﬂuid placed
in a cylindrical container with a moveable piston. When you slightly increase the force on the piston, the
volume of the chamber decreases, d V < 0. The pressure in the ﬂuid must necessarily increase, d p > 0. If
this were not the case, an arbitrarily small extra force would send the piston to the bottom of the chamber.
Since a larger volume diminishes proportionally more for a given pressure increase, we deﬁne the bulk
modulus as the pressure increase d p per fractional decrease in volume −d V /V , or
K =

dp
dp
dp
=
=ρ .
−d V /V
dρ/ρ

(4.33)

In the second step we have used the constancy of the mass d M = ρd V + V dρ = 0 to eliminate the volume,
d V /V = −dρ/ρ. The bulk modulus is a measure of incompressibility, and the larger it is, the greater
is the pressure increase that is needed to obtain a given fractional increase in density. As a measure of
compressibility one usually takes β = 1/K .

3000 atm [34]. As long as the pressure change is much smaller than the bulk modulus, d p
K , we may
estimate the relative change in density from (4.33) to be dρ/ρ ≈ d p/K . In the deepest abyss of the sea the
pressure is a bit more than 1000 atm, implying that the relative density change is dρ/ρ ≈ 1/22 ≈ 4.5%
(see also problem 4.7).
For an isothermal ideal gas it follows from the equation of state (4.27) that the bulk modulus is K T = p
where the index T reminds us that the temperature of the gas must be kept constant. The bulk modulus of
the nearly ﬂuid material of the Earth is plotted in ﬁgure 4.1 and varies roughly as K ≈ 4 p.

Pressure potential
For a barotropic ﬂuid we may integrate the local equation of hydrostatic equilibrium in much the same way
as we did for constant density in (4.21), by deﬁning
H=

It follows from the chain rule that ∇w( p) = (dw/d p)∇ p = (1/ρ)∇ p and using local hydrostatic
equilibrium (4.19) we obtain ∇ H = 0. In hydrostatic equilibrium H is always a constant, even when
the barotropic ﬂuid is compressible.
For an ideal gas under isothermal conditions, the pressure potential is calculated by means of the ideal
gas law (4.27),

In ﬂat-Earth gravity = g0 z, the constancy of H immediately leads back to the exponentially decreasing

4.6 The homentropic atmosphere
The assumption that the temperature is the same everywhere in the atmosphere is certainly wrong, as anyone
who has ever ﬂown in a modern passenger jet and listened to the pilot can testify. Temperature falls with

height instead of staying constant. So the atmosphere is not in isothermal equilibrium, and this is perhaps
not so surprising, since the ‘container walls’ of the atmosphere, the ground and outer space, have different
temperatures. There must be a heat ﬂow through the atmosphere between the ground and outer space,
maintained by the inﬂow of solar radiation and the outﬂow of geothermal energy. But air is a bad conductor
of heat, so although heat conduction does play a role, it is not directly the cause of the temperature drop in
the atmosphere.
Of much greater importance are the indirect effects of solar heating, the convection which creates air
currents, winds, and local turbulence, continually mixing different layers of the atmosphere. The lower part
of the atmosphere, the troposphere, is quite unruly and vertical mixing happens at time scales that are much
shorter than those required to reach thermal equilibrium. There is in fact no true hydrostatic equilibrium
state for the real atmosphere. Even if we disregard large-scale winds and weather systems, horizontal and
vertical mixing always takes place at small scales, and a realistic model of the atmosphere must take this
into account.

Blob-swapping
Let us imagine that we take a small blob of air and exchange it with another blob of air of the same mass,
but taken from a different height with a different volume and pressure. In order to ﬁll out the correct
volume, one air mass would have to be compressed and the other expanded. If this is done quickly, there
will be no time for heat exchange with the surrounding air, and one air mass will consequently be heated
up by compression and the other cooled down by expansion. If the atmosphere initially were in isothermal
equilibrium, the temperature of the swapped air would not be the same as the temperature of the surrounding
air, and the atmosphere would be brought out of equilibrium.
If, however, the surrounding air initially had a temperature distribution, such that the swapped air after
the expansion and compression would arrive at precisely the correct temperatures of their new surroundings,
a kind of thermodynamic ‘equilibrium’ could be established, in which the omnipresent vertical mixing had
essentially no effect. Intuitively, it is reasonable to expect that the end result of fast vertical mixing and
slow heat conduction might be precisely such a state. It should, however, not be forgotten that this state is
not a true equilibrium state but rather a dynamically balanced state depending on the incessant small-scale
motion in the atmosphere.

Isentropic processes in ideal gases
A process that takes place without exchange of heat between the system and its environment is said to be
adiabatic. If furthermore the process is reversible, it will conserve the entropy and is called isentropic.
From the thermodynamics of ideal gases (see appendix C) it follows that an isentropic process in a ﬁxed
amount M of an ideal gas will leave the expression pV γ unchanged. Here γ is the so-called adiabatic
index which for a gas like air with diatomic molecules is approximately γ ≈ 7/5 = 1.4. In terms of the
density ρ = M/V an isentropic process thus obeys,
p ρ −γ = C.

(4.37)

Whereas the ‘constants’ γ and C keep their values during a local isentropic process, they could in principle
vary with the position x.
The bulk modulus (4.33) of an isentropic gas is immediately found to be,
K S = γ p,

(4.38)

where the S indicates that the entropy must be kept constant during the compression. The pressure potential
(4.35) is similarly obtained,

The atmospheric temperature lapse rate
The atmosphere of the ﬂat Earth is translationally invariant in the horizontal directions, implying that γ and
C can only depend on z, but the blob-swapping argument indicates that both should also be independent of
z. The lower atmosphere, the troposphere, is at least approximatively in a so-called homentropic state in
which (4.37) is valid everywhere with the same values of γ and C.
In constant gravity we ﬁnd from (4.34) and (4.39) that
H = g0 z + c p T,

(4.41)

is independent of z, implying that the temperature drops linearly with height,

where T0 = H/g0 is the temperature at the surface z = 0. The magnitude of the vertical temperature

Both of these quantities vanish like the temperature for z = h 2 . At the top of Mount Everest (z = h 0 ) the
pressure is now predicted to be 312 hPa whereas the standard atmosphere data says it is 330 hPa.

The real atmosphere of Earth
In ﬁgure 4.2 the various atmospheric models for the pressure have been plotted together with data for the
standard atmosphere [41]. Even if the homentropic model gives the best ﬁt, it fails at higher altitudes. The
real atmosphere is in fact much more complicated than any of these models indicate.
Water vapour is always present in the atmosphere and will condense to clouds in rising currents of air.
The latent heat of condensation heats up the air, so that the temperature lapse rate becomes smaller than
10 K km−1 , perhaps more like 6–7 K km−1 , leading to a somewhat higher estimate for the temperature
at the top of Mount Everest. The clouds may eventually precipitate out as rain, and when the dried air
afterwards descends again, for example on the lee side of a mountain, the air will heat up at a higher rate
than it cooled during its ascent on the windward side and become quite hot, a phenomenon known as f¨ hn
o
in the Alps.
The fact that the temperature lapse rate is smaller in the real atmosphere than in the isentropic model
has a bearing on the stability of the atmosphere. If a certain amount of air is transported to higher altitude
without heat exchange and condensation of water vapour, it will behave like in the isentropic model and
become cooler than the surrounding air. Consequently it will also be heavier than the surrounding air
and tend to sink back to where it came from, implying that the atmosphere is stable. Conversely, if the
real temperature lapse becomes larger than in the isentropic model, the atmosphere becomes unstable and
strong vertical currents may arise. This can, for example, happen in thunderstorms.

ÙÓÝ Ò Ý
Fishes, whales, submarines, balloons and airships all owe their ability to ﬂoat to buoyancy, the lifting
power of water and air. The understanding of the physics of buoyancy goes back as far as antiquity and
probably sprung from the interest in ships and shipbuilding in classic Greece. The basic principle is due
to Archimedes. His famous Law states that the buoyancy force on a body is equal and oppositely directed
to the weight of the ﬂuid that the body replaces. Actually the Law was not just one law, but a set of four
propositions dealing with different conﬁgurations of body and liquid [70]. Before his time it was wrongly
thought that the shape of a body determined whether it would sink or ﬂoat.
The shape of a ﬂoating body and its mass distribution does, however, determine whether it will ﬂoat
stably or capsize. Stability of ﬂoating bodies is of importance to shipbuilding, and to anyone who has
ever tried to stand up in a small rowboat. Newtonian mechanics not only allows us to derive Archimedes’
Principle for the equilibrium of ﬂoating bodies, but also to characterize the deviations from equilibrium and
calculate the restoring forces. Even if a body ﬂoating in or on water is in hydrostatic equilibrium, it will
not be in complete mechanical balance in every orientation, because the centre of mass of the body and the
centre of mass of the displaced water, also called the centre of buoyancy, do not in general coincide.
The mismatch between the centers of mass and buoyancy for a ﬂoating body creates a moment of force,
which tends to rotate the body towards a stable equilibrium. For submerged bodies, submarines, ﬁshes and
balloons, the stable equilibrium will always be with the centre of gravity situated directly below the centre
of buoyancy. For bodies ﬂoating stably on the surface, ducks, ships and dumplings, the centre of gravity is
mostly found directly above the centre of buoyancy.

5.1 Archimedes’ principle
Mechanical equilibrium takes a slightly different form than global hydrostatic equilibrium (4.15) when a
body of another material is immersed in a ﬂuid. If its material is incompressible, the body retains its shape
and displaces an amount of ﬂuid with exactly the same volume. If the body is compressible, like a rubber
ball, the volume of displaced ﬂuid will be smaller. The body may even take in ﬂuid, like the piece of bread
you dunk into your coffee, but then the physics becomes more complicated, and we shall disregard this
possibility in the following. A body which is partially immersed may formally be viewed as a body that
is fully immersed in a ﬂuid for which the mass density and the equation of state vary from place to place.
This also covers the case where part of the body is in vacuum which may be thought of as a ﬂuid with the
extreme properties, ρ = p = 0.

Weight and buoyancy
Let the actual, perhaps compressed, volume of the immersed body be V with surface S. In the ﬁeld of
gravity an unrestrained body is subject to two forces: its weight
G =

V

ρbody g d V,

and the buoyancy due to pressure acting on its surface,
B =−

Gravity pulls on a body over
its entire volume, while pressure
only acts on the surface.

In general these two forces do not have to be in balance. The resultant
direction that the unrestrained body will begin to move. In mechanical equilibrium the two forces must
exactly cancel each other so that the body can remain in place.
Assuming that the body does not itself signiﬁcantly contribute to the ﬁeld of gravity, the local balance
of forces in the ﬂuid (4.19) will be the same as before the body was placed in the ﬂuid. In particular the
pressure in the ﬂuid cannot depend on whether the volume V contains material that is different from the
ﬂuid itself. The pressure on the surface of the immersed body must for this reason be identical to the
pressure on a body of ﬂuid of the same shape. But then the global equilibrium condition (4.15) tells us that
the buoyancy force will exactly balance the weight of the displaced ﬂuid, so that
B =−

This theorem is indeed Archimedes’ principle: the force of buoyancy equals (minus) the weight of the
displaced ﬂuid.
The total force on the body may now be written

(ρbody − ρﬂuid )g d V,

(5.4)

explicitly conﬁrming that when the body is made from the same ﬂuid as its surroundings, so that ρbody =
ρﬂuid , the resultant force vanishes automatically. In general, however, the distributions of mass in the body
and in the displaced ﬂuid will be different.

Karl Friedrich Hieronymus Freiherr von M¨ nchhausen (1720–
u
1797). German (Hanoveran) soldier, hunter, nobleman, and delightful story-teller. In one of his
stories, he lifts himself out of a
deep lake by pulling at his bootstraps.

Note that Archimedes’ principle is valid even if the gravitational ﬁeld varies appreciably across the
body. Archimedes principle fails, however, if the body is so large that its own gravitational ﬁeld
cannot be neglected, such as would be the case if an Earth-sized body fell into Jupiter’s atmosphere.
The extra compression of the ﬂuid near the surface of the body generally increases the buoyancy
force. In semblance with Baron von M¨ nchhausen’s adventure, the body in effect lifts itself by its
u
bootstraps (see problems 5.6 and 5.7).

Constant ﬁeld of gravity
If the gravitational ﬁeld is constant, g(x) = g 0 , the weight of the body is,
G = Mbody g 0 ,

(5.5)

B = −Mﬂuid g 0 .

(5.6)

and the buoyancy force becomes

Since the total force is the sum of these contributions, one might say that buoyancy acts as if the
displacement were ﬁlled with ﬂuid of negative mass −Mﬂuid . In effect the buoyancy force acts as a kind of
antigravity.
The total force on an unrestrained object is now,

5.2. THE GENTLE ART OF BALLOONING

61

If the body mass is smaller than the mass of the displaced ﬂuid, the total force is directed upwards, and
the unrestrained body will begin to move upwards. Alternatively, if the body is kept in place, the restraints
must deliver a force − to prevent the object from moving.
A body can only hover motionlessly in a ﬂuid if its mass equals the mass of the displaced ﬂuid,
Mbody = Mﬂuid .

(5.8)

Fish achieve this balance by adjusting the amount of water they displace through contraction and expansion
of an internal air-ﬁlled bladder. Submarines, in contrast, change their mass by pumping water in and out
of ballast tanks. Curiously, no animals seem to have developed balloons for ﬂoating in the atmosphere,
although both the physics and chemistry of ballooning appears to be within reach of biological evolution.

5.2 The gentle art of ballooning
The ﬁrst balloon ﬂights are credited to the Montgolﬁer brothers who in November 1783 ﬂew a manned
hot-air balloon, and to Jacques Charles who on December 1 that same year ﬂew a manned hydrogen gas
balloon. In the beginning there was an intense rivalry between the advocates of Montgolﬁer and Charles
type balloons which presented different advantages and dangers to the courageous ﬂiers. Hot air balloons
were easier to make but prone to catch ﬁre, while hydrogen balloons had greater lifting power but could
suddenly explode. By 1800 the hydrogen balloon had won the day, culminating in the huge (and dangerous)
hydrogen airships of the 1930s. Helium balloons are much safer, but also much more expensive to ﬁll. In
the last half of the twentieth century hot-air balloons again came into vogue, especially for sports, because
of the availability of modern strong lightweight materials (nylon) and fuel (propane).

Joseph
Michel
Montgolﬁer
(1740–1810). Experimented (together with his younger brother
´
Jacques Etienne (1745–1799))
with hot-air balloons.
On
November 21, 1783, the ﬁrst
human ﬂew in such a balloon for
a distance of 9 km at a height of
100 m above Paris. Only one of
the brothers ever ﬂew, and then
only once!

Gas balloons
A large hydrogen or helium balloon typically begins its ascent being only partially ﬁlled, assuming an
inverted tear-drop shape. During the ascent the gas expands because of the fall in ambient air pressure,
and eventually the balloon becomes nearly spherical and stops expanding (or bursts) because the ‘skin’ of
the balloon cannot stretch further. Since the density of the displaced air falls with height, the balloon will
eventually reach a maximum height, a ceiling where it could hover permanently if it did not lose gas. In the
end no balloon stays aloft forever.
Let the total mass of the balloon be M0 , including the mass of the gas, the balloon skin, the gondola,
people etc. The condition for upwards ﬂight is then that M0 ≤ Vρ where V is the total volume of air that
the balloon displaces and ρ the air density at its actual position. In the homentropic atmospheric model the
air density is given by (4.45), and the condition for upwards ﬂight at height z becomes,
M0 < ρ0 V 1 −

z 1/(γ −1)
h2

(5.9)

where γ ≈ 7/5 is the adiabatic index of air, ρ0 ≈ 1.2 kg m−3 its density at sea level, and h 2 ≈ 30 km
the isentropic scale height (4.44). If this inequality is fulﬁlled on the ground, the balloon will start to rise.
During the rise the volume may expand towards a maximal value while the air density falls, and the balloon
will keep rising until the inequality is no longer fulﬁlled, and the balloon has reached its ceiling.
Example 5.2.1: A gas balloon has a maximal spherical diameter of 10 m yielding a volume V ≈
524 m3 . For the balloon to lift-off at all, its mass must be smaller than ρ0 V = 628 kg. Taking
M0 = 400 kg the ceiling becomes z ≈ 5 km. At this height the air pressure is p = 0.53 atm and the
temperature T = 245 K = −29 ◦ C (ignoring humidity). Assuming that the balloon contains hydrogen
H2 (with MH2 = 2 g mol−1 and γ = 7/5) at this temperature and pressure, the total mass of the
hydrogen is merely 28 kg. The surface area of the balloon is 314 m2 , so if the skin has thickness 2 mm
and density 300 kg m−3 , its mass becomes 188 kg, which leaves about 400 − 28 − 188 = 184 kg for
the proper payload. Filled with helium He (with Mmol = 4 g mol−1 and γ = 5/3), the proper payload
would be reduced to 156 kg.

A hot-air balloon is open at the bottom so that the inside pressure is always the same as the atmospheric
pressure outside. The air in the balloon is warmer (T > T ) than the outside temperature and the density
is correspondingly lower (ρ < ρ). If M0 denotes the total mass of the balloon, including the gondola and
the passengers but not the hot air, the condition for ﬂight is now M0 < (ρ − ρ )V . From the ideal gas
law (4.27) and the equality of the inside and outside pressures it follows that ρ T = ρT , so that the inside
density is ρ = ρT/T . The condition for ﬂight at height z becomes,

T0 = 20 ◦ C = 293 K and the density ρ0 = 1.2 kg m−3 , it follows that this balloon would be capable
of lifting M0 ≈ 547 kg to the ceiling. Using the same parameters as for the gas balloon, the payload
becomes 123 kg.

5.3 Stability of ﬂoating bodies
Although a body may be in buoyant equilibrium, such that the total force composed of gravity and buoyancy
vanishes, = G + B = 0, it may not be in complete mechanical equilibrium. The total moment of all
the forces acting on the body must also vanish; otherwise an unrestrained body will start to rotate.

Moments of weight and buoyancy

Assuming again that the presence of the body does not change the pressure distribution in the ﬂuid, the

The moment of buoyancy equals the (minus) moment of gravity of the displaced ﬂuid. This result is a natural

proof of the theorem is found in problem 5.8.

5.3. STABILITY OF FLOATING BODIES

Constant gravity and buoyant equilibrium
In the remainder of this chapter we assume that gravity is constant, g(x) = g 0 , and that the body is in
buoyant equilibrium so that it displaces exactly its own mass of ﬂuid, Mﬂuid = Mbody = M. The densities
of body and displaced ﬂuid will, however, in general be different, ρbody = ρﬂuid .
The moment of gravity (5.12) may as before (page 32) be expressed in terms of the centre x G of the
body mass distribution (here called the centre of gravity),

ÅG = x G × M g 0 ,

1
xG =
M

xρbody d V.

(5.15)

Similarly the moment of the mass distribution of the displaced ﬂuid (5.14) is,

Å B = −x B × M g 0,

xB =

1
M

xρﬂuid d V,

(5.16)

where x B is the centre of buoyancy. Although each of these moments depends on the choice of origin of
the coordinate system, the total moment,

Å = (x G − x B ) × M g 0,

(5.17)

will be independent, as witnessed by the appearance of the difference of the two centre positions.
As long as the total moment is non-vanishing, the body is not in mechanical equilibrium, but will start
to rotate towards an orientation with vanishing moment. Except for the trivial case where the centers of
gravity and buoyancy coincide, the above equation tells us that the total moment can only vanish if the
centers lie on the same vertical line,
x G − x B ∝ g0 .

(5.18)

For x G = x B , there are two possible orientations satisfying this condition: one where the centre of gravity
lies above the centre of buoyancy, and another where the centre of gravity is lowest. At least one of these
will be stable.

Submerged body
For a fully submerged rigid body, for example a submarine, both centres are always in the same place
relative to the body. If the centre of gravity does not lie directly below the centre of buoyancy, but is
displaced horizontally, the direction of the moment will always tend to turn the body so that the centre
of gravity is lowered with respect to the centre of buoyancy. The only stable orientation of the body is
where the centre of gravity lies vertically below the centre of buoyancy. Any small perturbation away
from this orientation will soon be corrected and the body brought back to the equilibrium orientation. A
similar argument shows that the other equilibrium orientation with the centre of gravity above the centre of
buoyancy is unstable and will ﬂip the body over, if perturbed the tiniest amount.
This is why the gondola hangs below an airship or balloon, and why a ﬁsh goes belly-up when it dies,
because it loses control of the swim bladder which enlarges into the belly and reverses the positions
of the centers of gravity and buoyancy. It generally also loses buoyant equilibrium and ﬂoats to the
surface.

Body ﬂoating on the surface
At the surface of a liquid, a body such as a ship or an iceberg will according to Archimedes’ principle always
arrange itself so that the mass of displaced liquid exactly equals the mass of the body. Here we assume that
there is vacuum or a very light ﬂuid such as air above the liquid. The centre of gravity is always in the same
place relative to the body, but the centre of buoyancy depends now on the orientation of the body, because
the volume of displaced ﬂuid changes place and shape (while keeping its mass constant) when the body
orientation changes.
Stability can again only occur when the two centres lie on the same vertical line, but there may be
more than one stable orientation. A sphere made of homogeneous wood ﬂoating on water is stable in all

A ﬂoating body generally has
a stable equilibrium with the
centre of gravity directly above
the centre of buoyancy.

orientations. None of them are in fact truly stable, because it takes no force to move from one to the other.
This is however a marginal case.
A ﬂoating body may, like a submerged body, possess a stable orientation with the centre of gravity
directly below the centre of buoyancy. A heavy keel is, for example, used to lower the centre of gravity of
a sailing ship so much that this orientation becomes the only stable equilibrium. In that case it becomes
virtually impossible to capsize the ship, even in a very strong wind.
The stable orientation for most ﬂoating objects, such as ships, will in general have the centre of gravity
situated directly above the centre of buoyancy. This happens always when an object of constant mass
density ﬂoats on top of a liquid of constant mass density, for example an iceberg on water. The part of the
iceberg that lies below the waterline must have its centre of buoyancy in the same place as its centre of
gravity. The part of the iceberg lying above the water cannot inﬂuence the centre of buoyancy whereas it
always will shift the centre of gravity upwards.
How can that situation ever be stable? Will the moment of force not be of the wrong sign? Why don’t
ducks and tall ships capsize spontaneously? The qualitative answer is that when the body is rotated away
from such an equilibrium orientation, the volume of displaced water will change position and shift the
centre of buoyancy back to the other side of the centre of gravity, reversing the direction of the moment of
force to restore the equilibrium.

5.4 Ship stability
Sitting comfortably in a small rowboat, it is fairly obvious that the centre of gravity lies above the centre
of buoyancy, and that the situation is stable with respect to small movements of the body. But many a
ﬁsherman has learnt that suddenly standing up may compromise the stability and throw him out among the
ﬁshes. There is, as we shall see, a strict limit to how high the centre of gravity may be above the centre of
buoyancy. If this limit is violated, the boat becomes unstable and capsizes.

Figure 5.2. The Queen Mary 2 set sail on its maiden voyage on January 2, 2004. It is the world’s largest
ocean liner—ever—with a length of 345 m, a height of 72 m from keel to funnel, and a width of 41 m.
Having a draft of only 10 m, its superstructure rises an impressive 62 m over the waterline. The low average
density of the superstructure, including 2620 passengers and 1253 crew, combined with the high average
density of the 117 megawatt engines and other heavy facilities close to the bottom of the ship nevertheless
allow the stability condition to be fulﬁlled. Photograph by Daniel Carneiro.
We shall assume that the ship is initially in complete mechanical equilibrium with vanishing total force
and vanishing total moment of force. The aim is now to calculate the moment that arises when the ship is
brought slightly out of equilibrium. If the moment tends to turn the ship back into equilibrium, the initial
orientation is stable, otherwise it is unstable.

Displacement geometry
Most ships are mirror symmetric in a plane, but we shall be more general and consider a ‘ship’ of an
arbitrary shape. In a ﬂat earth coordinate system with vertical z-axis the ship displaces in equilibrium a
volume V0 of water below the waterline at z = 0. Since water has constant density, the centre of buoyancy
is simply the geometric average of the position over the displacement,
1

xB = x 0 =

(5.19)

In equilibrium the horizontal positions of the centres of buoyancy and gravity must be equal x B = x G and
y B = yG , whereas the vertical position z G of the centre of gravity depends on the actual mass distribution
of the ship, determined by its structure and load.
In practical calculations it pays to introduce the ship’s equilibrium area function A(z), deﬁned as the
horizontal area at depth z below the waterline. The displacement and the height of the centre of buoyancy

The tilt rotates the centre of
gravity from G to G , and the
centre of buoyancy from B to
B . In addition, the change in
displaced water shifts the centre
of buoyancy back to B . In stable
equilibrium this point must for
α > 0 lie to the left of the new
centre of gravity G .

In the waterline the ship covers a horizontal region A 0 = A(0) of arbitrary shape. The geometric centre of
this region is deﬁned by the area average of the position,
(x0 , y0 ) =

1
(x, y) d A,
A 0 A0

(5.22)

where d A = d x d y is the area element. Without loss of generality we may always place the coordinate
system such that x0 = y0 = 0. In a ship that is mirror symmetric in a plane, the area centre will also lie in
this plane.
To discover the physical signiﬁcance of the geometric centre of the waterline area, the ship is tilted (or
‘heeled’ in maritime language) through a tiny angle α around the x-axis, such that the equilibrium waterline
area A 0 comes to lie in the plane z = αy. The net change in the volume of the displaced water is to lowest
order in α given by the difference in volumes of the two wedge-shaped regions between new and the old
waterlines. Since the displaced water is removed from the wedge at y > 0 and added to the wedge for
y < 0, the signed volume change becomes
δV = −

A0

z d A = −α

A0

y d A = 0.

(5.23)

In the last step we have assumed that the origin of the coordinate system coincides with the geometric centre
of the waterline area. There will be corrections to this result of order α 2 due to the actual shape of the hull
just above and below the waterline, but they are disregarded here. To leading order the two wedges have
the same volume.
Since the direction of the x-axis is quite arbitrary, the conclusion is that the ship may be heeled around
any line going through the geometric centre of the waterline area without any ﬁrst order change in volume
of displaced water. This guarantees that the ship will remain in buoyant equilibrium during the tilt. The
geometric centre of the waterline area may thus be viewed as the ship’s centre of roll.

The metacentre
The tilt around the x-axis changes the positions of the centres of gravity and buoyancy. The centre of
gravity is (hopefully!) ﬁxed with respect to the ship and is to ﬁrst order in α shifted horizontally by a simple
rotation through the inﬁnitesimal angle α,
δyG = −αz G .

(5.24)

There will also be a vertical shift, δz G = αyG , but that is of no importance to the stability in the lowest
order of approximation.
The centre of buoyancy is at ﬁrst shifted by the same rule as the centre of gravity by the tilt, but because
the displacement also changes there will be another contribution y B , so that we may write
δy B = −αz B +

yB .

(5.25)

As discussed above, the change in displacement amounts to moving the water in the wedge at y > 0 to
the wedge at y < 0. The change in displacement is according to (5.19) calculated by averaging y over the
volume of the two wedges, taking the sign correctly into account,

This point, called the metacentre, is usually placed on the straight line (the ‘mast’) that goes through the
centres of gravity and buoyancy. The above calculation shows that when the ship is heeled through a small
angle, the centre of buoyancy will move so that it stays vertically below the metacentre.
The metacentre is a purely geometric quantity. The displacement as well as the vertical height of the
centre of buoyancy may be calculated from the area function of the ship using (5.20) and (5.21), and the
second order moment from the shape of the ship in the waterline. The simplest shapes are,

Notice that this is only about half of the result for the rectangle.

Stability condition
The tilt also generates a restoring moment around the x-axis, which may be calculated from (5.17),

Åx = −(yG − y B )Mg0 .

(5.31)

Since we have yG = y B in the original mechanical equilibrium, the difference in coordinates after the tilt
may be written, yG − y B = δyG − δy B where δyG and δy B are the small horizontal shifts of order α in the
centres of gravity and buoyancy, calculated above.
In terms of the metacentric height z M the restoring moment becomes

Åx = −α(z M − z G )Mg0 .

(5.32)

For the ship to be stable, the restoring moment must counteract the tilt and thus have opposite sign of the
tilt angle α. Consequently, the stability condition becomes
z M > zG .

(5.33)

Evidently, the ship is stable when the metacentre lies above the centre of gravity.
The orientation of the coordinate system with respect to the ship’s hull was not speciﬁed in the analysis
which is therefore valid for a tilt around any direction. For a ship to be fully stable, the stability condition

must be fulﬁlled for all possible tilt axes. Since the displacement V0 is the same for all choices of tilt axis,
the second moment of the area on the right hand side of (5.28) should be chosen to be the smallest one.
Often it is quite obvious which moment is the smallest. Many modern ships are extremely long with the
same cross section along most of their length and with mirror symmetry through a vertical plane. For such
ships the smallest moment is clearly obtained with the tilt axis parallel to the longitudinal axis of the ship.
The restoring moment (5.32) is proportional to the vertical distance, z M − z G , between the metacentre
and the centre of gravity. The closer the centre of gravity comes to the metacentre, the smaller will the
restoring moment be, and the longer will the period of rolling oscillations be. The actual roll period
depends also on the true moment of inertia of the ship around the tilt axis (see problem 5.11). Whereas
the metacentre is a purely geometric quantity which depends only on the ship’s actual draft, the centre of
gravity depends on the way the ship is actually loaded. A good captain should always know the positions
of the centre of gravity and the metacentre of his ship before he sails, or else he may capsize when casting
off.

mass is 75 kg and the boat’s is 50 kg, the displacement will be V0 = 0.125 m3 , and the draught
d ≈ V0 /4ab = 6.25 cm, ignoring the usually curved shape of the boat’s hull. The coordinate of the
centre of buoyancy becomes z B = −3.1 cm and the metacentre z M = 75 cm. Getting up from your
seat may indeed raise the centre of gravity so much that it gets close to the metacentre and the boat
begins to roll violently. Depending on your weight and mass distribution the boat may even become
unstable and turn over.

The simplest non-trivial case in which we may apply the stability criterion is that of a rectangular block
of dimensions 2a, 2b and 2c in the three coordinate directions. Without loss of generality we may assume
that a > b. The centre of the waterline area coincides with the roll centre and the origin of the coordinate
system with the waterline at z = 0. The block is assumed to be made from a uniform material with constant
density ρ1 and ﬂoats in a liquid of constant density ρ0 .

Ship with liquid cargo
Many ships carry liquid cargos, oil, water, etc. When the tanks are not completely ﬁlled this kind of cargo
may strongly inﬂuence the stability of the ship. In heavy weather or due to accidents, car ferries may
inadvertently also get a layer of water on the car deck. The main effect of an open liquid surface inside the
ship is that the centre of mass is shifted in the same direction by the redistribution of real liquid as the shift
in the centre of buoyancy due to the change in displaced water, i.e. towards negative y-values. This disturbs
the stability and creates a competition between the liquid carried by the ship and the water displaced by the
ship.
For the case of a single open tank the calculation of the restoring moment must now include the liquid
cargo. A similar analysis as before shows that there will be a horizontal change in the centre of gravity from
the movement of a wedge of real liquid of density ρ1 ,

where I1 is the second moment of the open liquid surface. The metacentric height now becomes

zM = zB + 0 − 1 1 .

(5.39)

The effect of the moving liquid is to lower the metacentric height with possible destabilization as a result.
The unavoidable sloshing of the liquid may further compromise the stability. The destabilizing effect of a
liquid cargo is often counteracted by dividing the hold into a number of smaller compartments by means of
bulkheads along the ship’s principal roll axis.
In car ferries almost any level h of water on the car deck may cause the ferry to capsize because
ρ1 = ρ0 and I1 ≈ I0 , making z M ≈ z B independent of h. As several accidents have shown, car
ferries are in fact highly susceptible to the destabilizing effects of water on the car deck. Waterproof
longitudinal bulkheads on the car deck of a car ferry are usually avoided because it would hamper
efﬁcient loading of the cars.

A ‘car ferry’ with water on
the deck is inherently unstable
because the movement of the real
water on the deck nearly cancels
the stabilizing movement of the
displaced water.

∗ Principal roll axis
It has already been remarked that the metacentre for absolute stability is determined by the smallest second
moment of the waterline area. Instead of tilting the ship around the x-axis, it is tilted around an axis
n = (cos φ, sin φ, 0) forming an angle φ with the x-axis. Since this conﬁguration is obtained by a simple
rotation through φ around the z-axis, the transverse coordinate to be used in calculating the second moment
becomes y = y cos φ − x sin φ (see equation (2.36b)), and we ﬁnd

Planets and stars are objects held together by their own gravity, but prevented from collapsing by internal
pressure, originating from repulsive atomic or nuclear forces. The more massive a body is, the higher
the pressure necessary to prevent collapse. For a sufﬁciently massive body ultimate gravitational collapse
cannot be prevented by any known forces, will eventually occur, and a black hole is born.
So far we have only been able to scratch the surface of our own planet Earth. A little has also been done
on the Moon and soon we shall know more about the surface of Mars. Seismic waves created by controlled
explosions do allow us to peer deeper into the planet, but mostly we are left with the ‘experiments’ carried
out by nature without any regard to us. Earthquakes generate strong seismic waves, revealing the inner
structure of the planet. Continental drift informs us about the mixture of heat and gravity deep inside.
Electromagnetic radiation from the surface of a star is almost the only source of information about what
goes on below, although neutrino observations have begun to provide a direct window into the deepest core
of our Sun, and into the supernovas that explode in our cosmic neighbourhood.
Most of our understanding of the interiors of planets and stars comes from using the laws of physics
determined on Earth as an ‘analytic drill’ allowing us to get insight into processes which cannot be directly
observed from the outside. In this chapter, the ﬁrst turns of this drill consist of applying the equations of
hydrostatic equilibrium to these massive self-gravitating bodies. The strongest simplifying assumption we
can make about planets and stars, is that they are spherically symmetric, but before we specialize to that case
we need to derive a fundamental differential equation connecting a mass distribution and its gravitational
ﬁeld. At the end of the chapter, we apply the formalism to a homentropic star without internal energy
production.

6.1 Gravitational ﬂux
Let S be a closed surface surrounding a volume V . We shall as before use the convention that the normal
n at a point x of the surface is always a unit vector oriented outwards from the surface, and a small surface
element of magnitude d S is represented by the vector d S = nd S. Seen from the origin of the coordinate
system, the solid angle subtended by this surface element is
d

=

x · dS
.
|x|3

(6.1)

Projecting the gravitational ﬁeld (3.12) from a point mass on to the surface element, one obtains
g · d S = −G Md .
This quantity is called the ﬂux of gravity through the surface element.
Consider now the total ﬂux through a closed convex surface containing the point mass at the origin.
All the little solid angles add up to 4π because the line-of-sight from the particle in any direction crosses

The lines-of-sight from a point
inside a convex volume crosses
the surface once, whereas they
cross twice if the mass is outside.

the convex surface exactly once. If, on the other hand, the surface does not contain the point mass, the
line-of-sight from the particle will always cross the surface twice, and the two contributions to the solid
angle will have the same magnitude but opposite sign and thus cancel. In other words,

S

g · dS =

−4π G M
0

for 0 ∈ V
otherwise.

(6.2)

This result is, in fact, valid for all surfaces, convex or not. For a convoluted surface, the line-of-sight from
the inside will instead cross the surface an odd number of times, and since the solid angles are evaluated
with sign, all the contributions along the line-of-sight cancel each other except for one. If the particle is
outside the volume the line-of-sight will cross an even number of times and all contributions cancel. The
conclusion is that the above equation holds in full generality.
Furthermore, this result cannot depend on the particle being at the origin, but must be generally valid
for any point particle inside or outside the volume. Adding together the contributions from all the material
particles in the volume V , we ﬁnally get

S

g · d S = −4π G

ρ d V.

V

(6.3)

The integral at the right is simply the total mass (3.2) within the volume, so we may conclude that the
gravitational ﬂux through any closed surface is proportional to the total mass contained within the surface,
whereas the mass outside the surface does not contribute to the ﬂux.

Gauss’ theorem and divergence
We have previously derived a vector relation (4.22) between the surface integral of a scalar ﬁeld and a
volume integral over its gradient. Applying it componentwise to the left-hand side of (6.3) we obtain

is the divergence (2.57) of the gravitational ﬁeld. Its value at a point is a measure of how much ﬁeld lines
diverge away from each other if it is positive, or converge if it is negative.
Gauss’ theorem is in this form a general relation between any vector ﬁeld g, not necessarily the
gravitation ﬁeld, and its divergence ∇ · g. The two forms, (4.22) and (6.4), are completely equivalent
(see problem 6.1).

Poisson’s equation
The global equation (6.3) relating the gravitational ﬁeld to its sources may now, like the global hydrostatic
equation (4.15), be converted to a local differential equation. Using Gauss’ theorem (6.4) we ﬁnd from (6.3)

(6.7)

This operator plays a major role in all ﬁeld theories.
Using that g = −∇ (see section 3.4), the source equation (6.6) may be rewritten in terms of the
gravitational potential, and we obtain Poisson’s equation,
∇2

= 4π Gρ.

(6.8)

The linearity of this equation guarantees that if 1 is a particular solution then the most general solution is
of the form = 0 + 1 where 0 is an arbitrary solution to Laplace’s equation,
∇ 2 0 = 0.

(6.9)

The actual solution selected in a particular problem depends on the boundary conditions.

Constant mass density: If the universe were uniformly ﬁlled with matter at constant density, ρ(x) =

ρ0 , we would have

∇2

= 4π Gρ0 .

(6.10)

It is easy to verify explicitly that a particular solution to this equation is

(6.11)

corresponding to a gravitational acceleration

g = − π Gρ0 x.

(6.12)

The gravitational ﬁeld always points towards the origin of the coordinate system which is thus imbued with
an apparently unphysical preferred status. In section 15.7 we shall see that this ﬁeld appears naturally in
Newtonian cosmology.

Hydrostatic equilibrium
One may rightly ask why we need Poisson’s equation when the complete connection between a mass
distribution and its gravitational potential is already given by the integral (3.24). For compressible matter,
however, the mass density depends on the pressure, which in turn depends on gravity through the equation
of hydrostatic balance (4.19), and gravity depends in turn on the mass density. Such physical circularity is
best handled by means of differential equations.
To see how this works out, we use (4.19) and (6.6) to calculate the divergence of g = ∇ p/ρ, and obtain
∇·

1
∇ p = −4π Gρ.
ρ

(6.13)

Together with a barotropic relation of the form p = p(ρ), this becomes a nonlinear, second-order partial
differential equation for the density ﬁeld.

6. PLANETS AND STARS

6.2 Spherical bodies
The mass distribution ρ(r ) for a spherically symmetric body such as a planet or a star is, as discussed in
section 3.3, only a function of the distance r = | x| from its centre, which is taken to be at the origin of the
coordinate system. The ﬁeld of gravity must correspondingly be radial, g( x) = g(r ) er , with er = x/r .
Applying the global source equation (6.3) to a spherical surface S(r ) of radius r , the surface integral on the
left-hand side becomes

S(r)

g · d S = 4π r 2 g(r ).

(6.14)

The volume integral on the right-hand side of (6.3) is simply the integrated mass M(r ) given in (3.18), so
that we obtain
g(r ) = −

G M(r )
.
r2

(6.15)

Finally, we have fulﬁlled the promise of deriving equation (3.17).
The general equation of hydrostatic equilibrium (6.13) simpliﬁes considerably for a spherical system,
and becomes an ordinary second-order differential equation for the pressure p(r ) or the density ρ(r ).
Instead of deriving this differential equation from (6.13), it is easier to go back to the original equation
of local hydrostatic equilibrium (4.19). Using that
∇ p(r ) =

d p(r )
d p(r )
∇r =

dr

we get from (4.19)
d p(r )

d M(r )
= −G4πr 2 ρ(r ),

and rearranging, this becomes
= −4π Gρ.

(6.17)

Combined with a barotropic equation of state of the form p = p(ρ), this is an ordinary second-order
differential equation for the density. In ﬁgure 6.1 the Earth’s pressure distribution is plotted and compared
with a simple model.

Boundary conditions
In principle, a second-order differential equation requires two boundary values (or integration constants),
for example the central pressure pc = p(0) and its ﬁrst derivative d p/dr for r = 0. We shall make the
reasonable assumption that the density ρc at the centre of the body is ﬁnite. Then for ‘small’ r we have
M(r ) ≈ 4 πr 3 ρc and equation (6.16) becomes for r → 0,

≈ − π Gρc r,

which integrates to

(6.18)

Thus, under the assumption of ﬁnite central density, the pressure is parabolic near the centre with d p/dr = 0
for r = 0. This shows that under reasonable physical assumptions the hydrostatic equation (6.17) requires in

fact only one boundary condition, for example the central pressure. Knowing pc together with the equation
of state (which also determines ρc ), the pressure may be calculated throughout the body.
The central pressure and density are, of course, not known for planets and stars, objects that are only
accessible from the outside. Most such bodies have a well-deﬁned surface radius, r = a, at which the
pressure vanishes. We shall arbitrarily call a body a planet, if the density jumps abruptly to zero at the
surface, and a star if the density vanishes along with the pressure at the surface. Such a convention makes
the gaseous giant planets, Jupiter and Saturn, count as stars even though they probably do not burn much
hydrogen.
The requirement of zero pressure at r = a will determine the central pressure. The solutions to the
hydrostatic equation can be expressed entirely in terms of the radius of the body and the parameters in the
equation of state. In particular the mass M0 of the body is—as we shall see below—calculable in terms
of a (and the state parameters). Conversely, if the mass and radius are known, one of the other unknown
parameters may be determined.

Planet with constant density
For a planet with constant density, ρ0 , the assumption of ﬁnite central density is exactly valid throughout
the planet,

p = pc − π Gρ0 r 2 .

(6.19)

At the surface of the planet where the pressure has to vanish this leads to

If the mass and radius are known, the density is obtained from M0 = 4 πa 3 ρ0 .

density 3.34 g cm−3 The central pressure is predicted to be 46 500 atm.

6.3 The homentropic star
Stars like the Sun are self-gravitating, gaseous and almost perfectly spherical bodies that generate heat by
thermonuclear processes in a fairly small region close to the centre. The heat is transferred to the surface
by radiation, conduction and convection and eventually released into space as radiation. Like planets, stars

also have a fairly complex structure with several layers differing in chemical composition and other physical
properties.
Example 6.3.1: Our Sun consists of a mixture of about 71% hydrogen, 27% helium and 2% other
elements. It has a central core of radius 150 000 km, a radiative layer of thickness 350 000 km, and
a convection layer of thickness 200 000 km. The ‘standard’ values [16] for the central parameters are
Tc = 15.7 × 106 K, ρc = 154 g cm−3 , and pc = 2.34 × 1011 bar.

The stellar temperature lapse rate
Here we shall completely ignore the layering, heat production and chemical composition, and concentrate
solely on hydrostatic equilibrium in a homogeneous star. We shall assume that the whole star consists of an
ideal gas with adiabatic index γ = 5/3, and molar mass Mmol = 0.5 g mol−1 . This corresponds to fully
ionized hydrogen, which consists af 50% hydrogen ions (protons) and 50% essentially massless electrons.
Apart from a layer near the surface, the effective adiabatic index, deﬁned by 1 − 1/γeff = d log T/d log p
is in fact very close to this value throughout the Sun (see ﬁgure 6.2 and problem 6.5).
In section 4.6 we argued (for the case of Earth’s atmosphere) that—provided the time scale for local
mixing is fast compared to heat conduction—a homentropic dynamical ‘equilibrium’ will be established
in which pρ −γ takes the same value everywhere (see appendix C). Assuming that the whole star is
homentropic and using the ideal gas law ρ ∼ p/T , we conclude that pρ −γ ∼ p1−γ T γ is also constant.
Differentiating log( p1−γ T γ ) after r we obtain,

where g(r ) = −G M(r )/r 2 is the acceleration ﬁeld, and c p = γ /(γ − 1) R/Mmol is the speciﬁc heat

6.3. THE HOMENTROPIC STAR

On the right-hand side we must use the constancy of pρ −γ ∼ Tρ 1−γ to eliminate the density and make it
a differential equation for T only.

Approximative solutions near the centre and the surface
There are many types of solutions to the stellar equations (6.21) or (6.22). Some have inﬁnite central
pressure, others have non-vanishing density all the way to inﬁnity (see problem 6.8). We shall limit
ourselves to solutions with ﬁnite central density and a well-deﬁned radius where the density and pressure
vanish.
If the central density ρc is ﬁnite, the integrated mass becomes M(r ) ≈ 4 πr 3 ρc near the centre, and
3
thus g(r ) ≈ − 4 π Gρc r . From (6.21) we then obtain,

where Tc is the central temperature. Evidently, the temperature drops parabolically when one moves away
from the centre of the star, and in the leading approximation this is also true for the pressure and the density.
If the density vanishes at the surface, r = a, the temperature and pressure must also vanish. From
(6.21) it follows that the temperature derivative is ﬁnite close to the surface at r = a, so that we may make
a linear approximation

where g0 = G M0 /a 2 is the magnitude of the star’s surface gravity. Note that this temperature, which sets
the scale of the temperature gradient at the surface, is calculable in terms of the star’s known parameters.
Example 6.3.2: Putting in the Sun’s parameters, M0 ≈ 2 × 1030 kg, a ≈ 7 × 108 m, and
c p ≈ 4.2 × 104 J K−1 kg−1 , we ﬁnd g0 ≈ 274 m s−2 and T0 ≈ 4.6 × 106 K. Even if the surface
approximation is not valid near the centre, T0 is nevertheless of the same magnitude as the Sun’s central
temperature.

The Lane–Emden solutions
Having determined the behaviour of the temperature near the centre as well as near the surface, we need to
interpolate between these regions. From the general discussion of boundary conditions in section 6.2, we
expect that the stellar equation (6.22) will create a connection between the central temperature Tc and the
calculable temperature parameter T0 .

From the solution near the centre of the star we conclude that the boundary conditions for θ(ξ ) are θ(0) = 1
and θ (0) = 0. The solutions form a family of functions parametrized by the adiabatic index γ .
Apart from special cases (see below and problem 6.8) this differential equation cannot be solved
analytically. In ﬁgure 6.3 the Lane–Emden functions have been evaluated numerically for a few relevant
values of γ . For γ > 6/5 it may be shown that the solutions cross the ξ -axis. This means that θ vanishes at
this point, which is identiﬁed with the boundary of the star and denoted ξ0 = ξ0 (γ ). Its precise value may
be calculated numerically for all γ > 6/5. A few relevant ones are given in the table in the margin.
The limiting cases of the Lane–Emden functions are easily determined analytically. For γ → 1,
corresponding to an isothermal star, the solution is θ(ξ ) → 1 so that T (r ) = Tc for all r (with a jump at the
surface that makes the star into a planet, according to our deﬁnition). For γ → ∞, we get from (6.19) and
the ideal gas√ θ(ξ ) → 1 − ξ 2 /6, which also follows from (6.29). This particular curve crosses the axis
law,
at ξ0 (∞) = 6 ≈ 2.45.

Figure 6.4. The temperature distribution in the Sun as a function of the distance from the centre. The fully
drawn curve is from the ‘standard’ Sun model [16] and the dashed curve is the Lane–Emden solution for
γ = 5/3. The vertical lines are boundaries between various layers of the Sun. The discrepancy between
the curves represents the thermonuclear heat production in the centre.
where ρ0 = M0 / 4 π a 3 is the average density of the star. Knowing both ρc and Tc allows us to determine
3
the central pressure, found from the ideal gas law pc = ρc RTc / Mmol .
Example 6.3.3: For γ = 5/3 we obtain Tc / T0 = 1.35 and ρc /ρ0 = 6.0. For the Sun this leads to a
central temperature of Tc = 6.2 × 106 K, a central density of ρc = 8.4 g cm−3 , and a central pressure
of pc = 8.7 × 109 bar. The temperature distribution is shown in ﬁgure 6.4 together with the data from
the ‘standard’ Sun model [16]. The agreement is reasonable, except in the deeper radiative layers and
the core where it fails because we have disregarded thermonuclear heat production.

∗ 6.4 Gravitational energy
What is the gravitational energy of a planet or a star? Since the gravitational potential of a ﬁnite body is
always negative and grows more negative the closer one gets to the body, one does not have to perform any
work to make such a body grow. It is sufﬁcient to throw material into the general vicinity of the body, and
let gravity do the rest. Consequently, the gravitational energy of a body is expected to be negative.
Gravity is in this respect different from most of the other forces we meet in daily life, for example
friction, where we have to perform work to get anything done. It does not cost us anything to make matter
collapse gravitationally, quite the contrary, we get paid for it (in heat). Matter is inherently unstable because
of gravity, and this instability [13] lies at the root of galaxy and star formation, and thus of everything that
is.

Assembly work
In chapter 3 it was shown that the work required to move a small particle of mass m from spatial inﬁnity,
where the gravitational potential vanishes, to a point x, where the potential takes the value (x), is m (x).
After you have done this (negative) work, it is conserved as (potential) energy of the particle.
Imagine now that we wish to increase the mass density inside a volume V by an amount δρ(x). The
total work required to assemble this extra mass by bringing each material particle in from spatial inﬁnity is,
δW =

V

δρ d V.

(6.32)

The added mass density δρ will change the potential both inside and outside V by an equally small amount
δ , but its contribution to the work will be of higher order in δρ and can be disregarded. If no other energy

is added to or removed from the body, the above work will be stored in the body as gravitational energy.

(6.33)

= −x · g 0 we get,

For a constant gravitational ﬁeld g 0 where

W = −x M · M g 0 ,

(6.34)

where as before x M is the centre of mass (3.3). With respect to potential energy, a body in a constant
gravitational ﬁeld is also equivalent to a point particle with the total mass situated at the centre of mass.

Gravitational self-energy
For a mass distribution assembled in its own ﬁeld, the situation is slightly more complicated. Intuitively it
is perhaps clear that each particle used to assemble the body on average meets only half the ﬁeld of the ﬁnal
body. Hence the energy is expected to be only half of (6.33).
To show that there is indeed such a factor 1/2 we shall employ a frequently used trick. Let us
imagine that we build up the mass distribution in such a way that it is everywhere proportional to the
ﬁnal distribution. At any given moment, a certain fraction λρ of the ﬁnal distribution is already in place,
where 0 < λ < 1. Since the potential is linear in the mass distribution, the current potential will also be
the same fraction λ of the ﬁnal potential. Increasing the fraction of the mass distribution by δλ will then
according to (6.32) cost an amount of work,
δW =

(λ )(δλ ρ) d V = λδλ

ρ d V,

(6.35)

where the integrals now run over all space. Integrating over λ from 0 to 1, we get the total amount of work
we have to perform in building up the complete mass distribution from scratch,
W =

1
2

ρ d V.

(6.36)

This work also equals the total gravitational self-energy = W stored in the mass distribution. Since the
potential of a ﬁnite mass distribution normalized to vanish at inﬁnity is always negative, the gravitational
energy will also be negative, as we foresaw at the beginning of this section.

Planet with constant density
A planet of radius a with constant density ρ0 and mass M0 = 4 πa 3 ρ0 has the simple potential (3.19).

In the last step we have introduced the surface gravity g0 of the planet. In spite of the primitive nature of
the model, this expression may be used as an order of magnitude estimate of the gravitational energy of a
planet, or even a star.
Example 6.4.1: For the Moon we get = −8.3 × 1028 J, for Earth = −1.5 × 1032 J and for
= −1.5 × 1041 J. Since the Sun’s energy output is 3.85 × 1026 W, it could only last
the Sun
for 3.9 × 1014 s or about 12.5 million years before the gravitational energy that was converted into
heat during its assembly would have been used up. This paradox was resolved in the 1930s with the
understanding of the thermonuclear processes responsible for the Sun’s energy production.

PROBLEMS

83

Field energy density
The total gravitational self-energy of a body (6.36) only receives contributions from regions where the mass
density is non-zero. It is possible to transform it into a relation involving only the ﬁeld strength g by making
use of the relationship,
∇ · ( g) =

∇ · g + (g · ∇) ,

(6.38)

which is most easily proven by writing it explicitly out in coordinates. Integrating over a volume V and
using Gauss’ theorem (6.4) on the left-hand side we obtain

S

g · dS =

V

∇ · ( g) d V = −4π G

V

ρ dV −

V

g2 ,

where on the right-hand side the deﬁnition of the potential (3.20) and the gravitational source equation (6.6)
have also been used.
If we now let the volume V expand to include all of space, the left-hand side will tend towards zero,
because at large distance r we have ∼ 1/r and g ∼ 1/r 2 , whereas the surface area expands only as r 2 .
In the limit we may thus rewrite the gravitational energy (6.36) in the form
=−

1
8π G

g 2 d V.

(6.39)

This form also explicitly demonstrates that the gravitational self-energy of a body is always negative.
In the spherical case we use (3.17) and obtain

2
r2
0

(6.40)

This integral always converges for a body of ﬁnite mass, i.e. provided M(r ) → M0 for r → ∞, even if it
has no boundary. Inserting M(r ) = 4 πr 3 ρ0 one immediately recovers (6.37).
3

Where is the energy?
Until now we have calculated the total gravitational energy from the non-local interaction of the mass
density with itself through the potential (3.24). It now seems that equation (6.39) tells us that it may also
be viewed as arising from a local distribution of energy over all of space. The gravitational energy density
is −g(x)2 /8π G which is non-vanishing even in regions of space completely devoid of matter. As we
discussed in section 1.4, the question of whether there is really energy out there in space depends largely
on your theoretical frame of mind. In classical Newtonian physics, rewriting the self-energy as an integral
over an energy density is just another mathematical trick.

ÀÝ ÖÓ×Ø Ø × Ô ×
It is primarily the interplay between gravity and contact forces that shapes the macroscopic world around
us. The seas, the atmosphere, planets and stars all owe their shape to gravity, and even our own bodies bear
witness to the strength of gravity at the surface of our massive planet. What physics principles determine
the shape of the surface of the sea? The sea is obviously horizontal at short distances, but bends below the
horizon at larger distances following the planet’s curvature. The Earth as a whole is spherical and so is the
sea, but that is only the ﬁrst approximation. The Moon’s gravity tugs at the water in the seas and raises
tides, and even the massive Earth itself is ﬂattened by the centrifugal forces of its own rotation.
Disregarding surface tension, the simple answer is that in hydrostatic equilibrium with gravity, an
interface between two ﬂuids of different densities, for example the sea and the atmosphere, must coincide
with a surface of constant potential, an equipotential surface. Otherwise, if an interface crosses an
equipotential surface, there will arise a tangential component of gravity which can only be balanced by
shear contact forces which a ﬂuid at rest is unable to supply. An iceberg rising out of the sea does not obey
this principle because it is solid, not ﬂuid. Neither is the principle valid for ﬂuids in motion. Waves in the
sea are in fact ‘waterbergs’ that normally move along the surface, but under special circumstances are able
stay in one place, as for example in a river ﬂowing past a big stone.
In this chapter the inﬂuence of gravity on the shape of large bodies of ﬂuid is analysed, the primary
goal being the calculation of the size and shape of the tides. Centrifugal forces give rise to a gravity-like
ﬁeld, which shapes all rotating ﬂuid bodies with open surfaces, for example a bucket of water or a planet.
Surface tension only plays a role for small bodies of ﬂuid and will be discussed in chapter 8.

7.1 Fluid interfaces in hydrostatic equilibrium
The intuitive argument about the impossibility of creating a hydrostatic ‘waterberg’ must in fact follow
from the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium. We shall now show that hydrostatic equilibrium implies that
the interface between two ﬂuids with different densities ρ1 and ρ2 must be an equipotential surface.
Since the gravitational ﬁeld is the same on both sides of the interface, hydrostatic balance ∇ p = ρ g
implies that there is a jump in the pressure gradient across the interface, because on one side (∇ p)1 = ρ1 g
and on the other (∇ p)2 = ρ2 g. If the ﬁeld of gravity has a component tangential to the interface, there
will consequently be a jump in the tangential pressure gradient. If the pressures are equal at one point, they
must therefore be different a little distance away along the surface. Newton’s third law, however, requires
pressure to be continuous everywhere, even across an interface (as long as there is no surface tension),
so this problem can only be avoided if the tangential component of gravity vanishes everywhere at the
interface, implying that it is an equipotential surface.
If, on the other hand, the ﬂuid densities are exactly the same on both sides of the interface but the ﬂuids
themselves are different, the interface is not forced to follow an equipotential surface. This is, however,
an unusual and highly unstable situation. The smallest deviation from equality in density on the two sides

If isobars and equipotential surfaces cross, hydrostatic balance
∇ p + ρ∇ = 0 becomes impossible.

Surfaces of constant pressure, satisfying p( x) = p0 , are called isobars. Through every point of space
runs one and only one isobar, namely the one corresponding to the pressure at that point. The gradient
of the pressure is everywhere normal to the local isobar surface, like gravity, g = −∇ , is everywhere
normal to the local equipotential surface, deﬁned by ( x) =
0 . Local hydrostatic equilibrium,
∇ p = ρ g = −ρ∇ , tells us that the normal to the isobar is everywhere parallel with the normal to
the equipotential surface. This can only be the case if isobars coincide with equipotential surfaces in
hydrostatic equilibrium. If an isobar crossed an equipotential surface anywhere at a ﬁnite angle the two
normals could not be parallel.
Since the curl of a gradient trivially vanishes, ∇ × ∇ f = 0, it follows from hydrostatic equilibrium that
0 = ∇ × (ρ g) = ∇ρ × g + ρ∇ × g = −∇ρ × ∇ .

(7.1)

This implies that ∇ρ ∼ ∇ , so the surfaces of constant density must also coincide with the equipotential
surfaces in hydrostatic equilibrium.

7.2 Shape of rotating ﬂuids

¹
¶
¨¨ x
¨
¨¨ x
r

The geometry of a rotating system is characterized by a rotation
vector
directed along the axis
of rotation, with magnitude equal
to the angular velocity. The vector r is directed orthogonally out
from the axis to a point x.

Newton’s second law of motion is only valid in inertial coordinate systems, where free particles move on
straight lines with constant velocity. In rotating, or otherwise accelerated, non-inertial coordinate systems,
one may formally write the equation of motion in their usual form, but the price to be paid is the inclusion
of certain force-like terms that do not have any obvious connection with material bodies, but derive from
the overall motion of the coordinate system (see chapter 20 for a more detailed analysis). Such terms are
called ﬁctitious forces, although they are by no means pure ﬁction, as one becomes painfully aware when
standing in a bus that suddenly stops. A more reasonable name might be inertial forces, since they arise as
a consequence of the inertia of material bodies.

Antigravity of rotation
A material particle at rest in a coordinate system rotating with constant angular velocity in relation to
an inertial system will experience only one ﬁctitious force, the centrifugal force. We all know about this
from carousels. It is directed perpendicularly outwards from the axis of rotation and of magnitude M r 2 ,
where r is the shortest distance to the axis.
In a rotating coordinate system placed with its origin on the rotation axis, and z-axis coincident with
it, the shortest vector to a point x = (x, y, z) is r = (x, y, 0). The centrifugal force is proportional to the
mass of the particle and thus mimics a gravitational ﬁeld
g centrifugal(r) = r 2 = (x, y, 0) 2 .

(7.3)

Since the centrifugal ﬁeld is directed away from the axis of rotation the centrifugal ﬁeld is a kind of
antigravity ﬁeld, which will try to split things apart and lift objects off a rotating planet. The antigravity
ﬁeld of rotation is, however, cylindrical in shape rather than spherical and has consequently the greatest
inﬂuence at the equator of Earth. If our planet rotated once in a little less than 1.5 hours, people at the
equator could (and would) actually levitate!

Newton’s bucket
A bucket of water on a rotating plate is an example going right back to Newton himself. Internal friction
(viscosity) in the water will after some time bring it to rest relative to the bucket and plate, and the whole
thing will end up rotating as a solid body. In a rotating coordinate system with z-axis along the axis of
rotation, the total gravitational ﬁeld becomes g = ( 2 x, 2 y, −g0 ), including both ‘real’ gravity and the
‘ﬁctitious’ centrifugal force. Correspondingly, the total gravitational potential is,

2

(7.5)

The water surface in rotating
bucket forms a parabolic shape
because of centrifugal forces.

where p0 is the pressure at the origin of the coordinate system. It grows towards the rim, reﬂecting
everywhere the change in height of the water column.
The isobars and equipotential surfaces are in this case rotation paraboloids,
z = z0 +

2

2g0

(x 2 + y 2 ),

(7.6)

where z 0 is a constant. In a bucket of diameter 20 cm rotating once per second the water stands 2 cm higher
at the rim than in the centre.
Example 7.2.1: An ultracentrifuge of radius 10 cm contains water and rotates at = 60 000 rpm ≈
6300 s−1 . The centrifugal acceleration becomes 400 000 times standard gravity and the maximal
pressure close to 2000 atm, which is double the pressure at the bottom of the deepest abyss in the
sea. At such pressures, the change in water density is about 10%.

∗ Stability of rotating bodies
Including the centrifugal ﬁeld (7.2) in the fundamental ﬁeld equation (6.6), the divergence of the total
acceleration ﬁeld g = g gravity + g centrifugal becomes,
∇ · g = −4π Gρ + 2 2 .

(7.7)

Effectively, centrifugal forces create a negative mass density − 2 /2π G. This is, of course, a purely
formal result, but it nevertheless conﬁrms the ‘antigravity’ aspect of centrifugal forces, which makes gravity
effectively repulsive wherever 2 /2π Gρ > 1.
For a spherical planet stability against levitation at the equator requires the centrifugal force at the
equator 2 a to be smaller than surface gravity, g0 = G M/a 2 = 4 πρ0 Ga, which leads to the stronger

Inserting the parameters of the Earth we ﬁnd q ≈ 1/291. At the end of section 7.4 the inﬂuence of the
deformation caused by rotation is also taken into account, leading to an even stricter stability condition.

7.3 The Earth, the Moon and the tides
Kepler thought that the Moon would inﬂuence the waters of Earth and raise tides, but Galilei found this
notion of Kepler’s completely crazy and compared it to common superstition. After Newton we know that
the Moon’s gravity acts on everything on Earth, also on the water in the sea, and attempts to pull it out of
shape, thereby creating the tides. But since high tides occur roughly at the same time at antipodal points of
the Earth, and twice a day, the explanation is not simply that the Moon lifts the sea towards itself.

7. HYDROSTATIC SHAPES
Galileo wrote about Kepler: ‘But among all the great men who have philosophized about this
remarkable effect, I am more astonished at Kepler than at any other. Despite his open and acute
mind, and though he has at his ﬁngertips the motions attributed to the earth, he has nevertheless lent
his ear and his assent to the moon’s dominion over the waters, and to occult properties, and to such
puerilities.’ (see [15, p. 145]).
The best natural scientists and mathematicians of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries worked on the
dynamics of the tides, but here we shall only consider the simplest possible case of a quasi-static Moon. For
a more complete discussion, including the dynamics of tidal waves, see, for example, Sir Horace Lamb’s
classic book [36] or [48] for a modern account.

We shall limit ourselves to studying the Moon’s inﬂuence on a liquid surface layer of the Earth. The solid
parts of the Earth will, of course, also react to the Moon’s ﬁeld, but the effects are somewhat smaller and are
due to elastic deformation rather than ﬂow. This deformation has been indirectly measured to a precision of
a few per cent in the daily 0.1 ppm variations in the strength of gravity (see ﬁgure 7.1 on page 90). There
are also tidal effects in the atmosphere, but they are dominated by other atmospheric motions.
We shall furthermore disregard the changes to the Earth’s own gravitational potential due to the shifting
waters of the tides themselves, as well as the centrifugal antigravity of Earth’s rotation causing it to deviate
from a perfect sphere (which increases the tidal range by slightly more than 10%, see section 7.4). Under
all these assumptions the gravitational potential at a height h over the surface of the Earth is to ﬁrst order in
h given by

The Moon
The Moon is not quite spherical, but nevertheless so small and far away that we may approximate its
potential across the Earth with that of a point particle −Gm/|x − x 0 | situated at the Moon’s position x 0
with the Moon’s mass m. Choosing a coordinate system with the origin at the centre of the Earth and the
z-axis in the direction of the Moon, we have x 0 = (0, 0, D) where D = |x 0 | is the Moon’s distance. Since
the Moon is approximately 60 Earth radii (a) away, i.e. D ≈ 60a, the Moon’s potential across the Earth
(for r = |x| ≤ a) may conveniently be expanded in powers of x/D, and we ﬁnd to second order

The ﬁrst term in this expression leads to a constant potential −Gm/D, which may of course be ignored. The
second term corresponds to a constant gravitational ﬁeld in the direction towards the moon gz = Gm/D 2 ≈
30 µm s−2 , which is precisely cancelled by the centrifugal force due to the Earth’s motion around the
common centre-of-mass of the Earth–Moon system (an effect we shall return to below). Spaceship Earth
is therefore completely unaware of the two leading terms in the Moon’s potential, and these terms cannot
raise the tides. Galilei was right to leading non-trivial order, and that’s actually not so bad.
Tidal effects come from the variation in the gravitational ﬁeld across the Earth, to leading order given
by the third term in the expansion of the potential. Introducing the angle θ between the direction to the

This expansion may of course be continued indeﬁnitely to higher powers of r/D. The coefﬁcients Pn (cos θ)
are called Legendre polynomials (here P2 (cos θ) = 1 (3 cos2 θ − 1)).

The gravitational ﬁeld of the Moon is found from the gradient of the potential. It is simplest to convert
back to Cartesian coordinates, writing (3 cos2 θ − 1)r 2 = 2z 2 − x 2 − y 2 , before calculating the gradient.

Projecting on the local normal er = (sin θ, 0, cos θ) and tangent eθ = (cos θ, 0, − sin θ) to the Earth’s

The magnitude of the horizontal component is maximal for θ = 45o (and, of course, also 135◦ because of
symmetry).
Concluding, we repeat that tide-generating forces arise from variations in the Moon’s gravity across the
Earth. As we have just seen, the force is generally not vertical, but has a horizontal component of the same
magnitude. From the sign and shape of the potential as a function of angle, we see that effectively the Moon
lowers the gravitational potential just below its position, and at the antipodal point on the opposite side of
the Earth, exactly as if there were shallow ‘valleys’ at these places. Sometimes these places are called the
Moon and anti-Moon positions.

The tides
If the Earth did not rotate and the Moon stood still above a particular spot, water would rush in to ﬁll up
these ‘valleys’, and the sea would come to equilibrium with its open surface at constant total gravitational
potential. The total potential near the surface of the Earth is

The Moon’s gravity with common acceleration cancelled. This
also explains why the variations
in tidal height have a semidiurnal period.

(measured in Stanford, California, on December 8–9, 1996 [56]; reproduced here with permission). The
semidiurnal as well as diurnal tidal variations are prominently visible as dips in the curves. Modelling the
Earth as a solid elastic object and taking into account the effects of ocean loading, the measured data is
reproduced to within a few times 10−9 g0 .

Tidal range

positions at θ = 0 and θ = 90◦ ,

where the last equation is obtained using g0 = G M/a 2 with M being the Earth’s mass. Inserting the values
for the Moon we get H0 ≈ 54 cm. Interestingly, the range of the tides due to the Sun turns out to be half
as large, about 25 cm. This makes spring tides when the Sun and the Moon cooperate almost three times
higher than neap tides when they do not.
For the tides to reach full height, water must move in from huge areas of the Earth as is evident from
the shallow shape of the potential. Where this is not possible, for example in lakes and enclosed seas, the
tidal range becomes much smaller than in the open oceans. Local geography may also inﬂuence tides. In
bays and river mouths funnelling can cause tides to build up to huge values. Spring tides in the range of
15 m have been measured in the Bay of Fundy in Canada.

∗ Quasi-static tidal cycles
The rotation of the Earth cannot be neglected. If the Earth did not rotate, or if the Moon were in a
geostationary orbit, it would be much harder to observe the tides, although they would of course be there
(problem 7.5). It is, after all, the cyclic variation in the water level observed at the coasts of seas and large
lakes which makes the tides observable. Since the axis of rotation of the Earth is neither aligned with the
direction to the Moon nor orthogonal to it, the tidal forces acquire a diurnal cycle superimposed on the
‘natural’ semidiurnal one. This is clearly seen in the data plotted in ﬁgure 7.1.
For a ﬁxed position on the surface of the Earth, the dominant variation in the lunar zenith angle θ is
due to Earth’s diurnal rotation with angular rate = 2π/24 h ≈ 7 × 10−5 radians per second. In addition,
there are many other sources of periodic variations in the lunar angle [48], which we shall ignore here.
The dominant such source is the lunar orbital period of a little less than a month. Furthermore, the
orbital plane of the Moon inclines about 5◦ with respect to the ecliptic (the orbital plane of the Earth
around the Sun), and precesses with this inclination around the ecliptic in a little less than 19 years.

Copyright © 2005 IOP Publishing Ltd.

7.4. SHAPE OF A ROTATING FLUID PLANET

91

The Earth’s equator is itself inclined about 23◦ to the ecliptic and precesses around it in about 25 000
years. Due to lunar orbit precession, the angle between the equatorial plane of the Earth and the
plane of the lunar orbit will range over 23 ± 5◦ , i.e. between 18◦ and 28◦ , in about 9 years.
Let the ﬁxed observer position at the surface of the Earth have (easterly) longitude φ and (northerly)
latitude δ. The lunar angle θ is then calculated from the spherical triangle formed by the north pole, the
lunar position and the observer’s position,
cos θ = sin δ sin δ0 + cos δ cos δ0 cos( t + φ).

(7.16)

Here δ0 is the latitude of the lunar position and the origin of time has been chosen such that the Moon at
t = 0 is directly above the meridian φ = 0.
Inserting this into the static expression for the tidal height (7.14), we obtain the quasi-static height
variation with time at the observer’s place, which becomes the sum of a diurnal and a semidiurnal cycle
h = h + h 1 cos( t + φ) + h 2 cos 2( t + φ).

Here h is the time-averaged height, and h 1 = 1 H0 sin 2δ sin 2δ0 and h 2 = 1 H0 cos2 δ cos2 δ0 are the
2
2
diurnal and semidiurnal tidal amplitudes. The full tidal range is not quite 2h 1 + 2h 2 , because the two
cosines cannot simultaneously take the value −1 (see problem 7.6).
To go beyond the quasi-static approximation, the full theory of ﬂuid dynamics on a rotating planet
becomes necessary. The tides will then be controlled not only by the tide-generating forces, but also by the
interplay between the inertia of the moving water and friction forces opposing the motion. High tides will
no more be tied to the Moon’s instantaneous position, but may be both delayed and advanced relative to it.

∗ Inﬂuence of the Earth–Moon orbital motion
A question is sometimes raised concerning the role of centrifugal forces from the Earth’s motion around
the centre-of-mass of the Earth–Moon system. This point lies at a distance d = Dm/(m + M) from the
centre of the Earth, which is actually about 1700 km below the surface, and during a lunar cycle the centre
of the Earth and the centre of the Moon move in circular orbits around it. Were the Earth (like the Moon)
in bound rotation so that it always turned the same side towards the Moon, one would (in the corotating
coordinate system, where the Moon and the Earth have ﬁxed positions) have to add a centrifugal potential to
the previously calculated potential (7.13), and the tidal range (see problem 7.7) would become about 14 m!
Luckily, this is not the case. The Earth’s own rotation is ﬁxed with respect to the inertial system of
the ﬁxed stars (disregarding the precession of its rotation axis). A truly non-rotating Earth would, in the
corotating system, rotate backwards in synchrony with the lunar cycle, cancelling the centrifugal potential.
Seen from the inertial system, the circular orbital motion imparts the same centripetal acceleration 2 d
(along the Earth–Moon line) to all parts of the Earth. This centripetal acceleration must equal the constant
gravitational attraction, Gm/D 2 , coming from the linear term in the Moon’s potential, and equating the two,
one obtains 2 = Gm/D 2 d = G M/D 3 , which is the well-known Kepler equation relating the Moon’s
period of revolution to its mass and distance.
The Moon always turns the same side towards Earth and the bound rotation adds in fact a centrifugal
component on top of the tidal ﬁeld from Earth. Over time these effects have together deformed the Moon
into its present egg-like shape.

∗ 7.4 Shape of a rotating ﬂuid planet
On a rotating planet, centrifugal forces will add a component of ‘antigravity’ to the gravitational
acceleration ﬁeld, making the road from the pole to equator slightly downhill. At Earth’s equator the
centrifugal acceleration amounts to only q ≈ 1/291 of the surface gravity, so a ﬁrst guess would be that
there is a centrifugal ‘valley’ at the equator with a depth of 1/291 of the Earths radius, which is about
22 km. If such a difference suddenly came to exist on a spherical Earth, all the water would like huge tides
run towards the equator. Since there is land at the equator, we may conclude that even the massive Earth
must over time have ﬂowed into the centrifugal valley. The difference between the equatorial and polar radii
is in fact 21.4 km [34], and coincidentally, this is roughly the same as the difference between the highest
mountain top and the deepest ocean trench on Earth.

7. HYDROSTATIC SHAPES
The ﬂattening of the Earth due to rotation is, like the tides, a problem which has attracted the best minds
of past centuries [36]. We shall here consider the simplest possible model, which nevertheless captures all
the features relevant to slowly rotating planets.

Rigid spherical planet
If a spherical planet rotates like a stiff body, the gravitational potential above the surface will be composed
of the gravitational potential of planet and the centrifugal potential. In spherical coordinates we have,
0 = −g0

(7.19a)
(7.19b)

where q = 2 a/g0 is the ‘levitation parameter’ deﬁned in (7.8). This conﬁrms that the magnitude of
vertical gravity is reduced, and that horizontal gravity points towards the equator. For Earth the changes are
all of relative magnitude q ≈ 1/291.

Fluid planet
Suppose now the planet is made from a heavy ﬂuid which given time will adapt its shape to an equipotential
surface of the form,
r = a + h(θ),
with a small radial displacement, |h(θ)|

If we naively disregard the extra gravitational ﬁeld created by the displacement of material, the potential is
given by (7.18). On the displaced surface this becomes to ﬁrst order in the small quantities h and q,
0 ≈ g0 h − g0 a(1 +

Demanding that it be constant, it follows that
h = h 0 sin2 θ −

(7.23)

The −(2/3) in the parenthesis has been chosen such that (7.21) is fulﬁlled. For Earth we ﬁnd h 0 = 11 km,
which is only half the expected result.

Including the self-potential
This result shows that the gravitational potential of the shifted material must play an important role.
Assuming that the shifted material has constant density ρ1 , the extra gravitational potential due to the
shifted material is calculated from (3.24) by integrating over the (signed) volume V occupied by the
shifted material,

(7.24)

Since the shifted material is a thin layer of thickness h, the volume element becomes d V ≈ h(θ )d S where
d S is the surface element of the original sphere, x = a. There are, of course, corrections but they will

be of higher order in h. The square of the denominator may be written as x − x = r 2 + a 2 − 2r a cos ψ
where ψ is the angle between x and x . Consequently we have to linear order in h

where cos ψ = cos θ cos θ +sin θ sin θ cos φ and d S = a 2 sin θ dθ dφ . Note that this is exactly the same
potential as would have been obtained from a surface distribution of mass with surface density ρ1 h(θ).
There are various ways to do this integral. We shall use a wonderful theorem about Legendre
polynomials, which says that a mass distribution with an angular dependence given by a Legendre
polynomial creates a potential with exactly the same angular dependence. So, if we assume that the
surface shape is of the form (7.23) with angular dependence proportional to P2 (cos θ) = 1 (3 cos2 θ − 1) =
2
1 (2 − 3 sin2 θ), the effective surface mass distribution will be proportional to P (cos θ), implying that the

(7.23) with,

1 − 3 ρ1

(7.29)

For Earth, the average density of the mantle material is ρ1 ≈ 4.5 g cm−3 whereas the average density is
ρ0 ≈ 5.5 g cm−3 . With these densities and q = 1/291 one gets h 0 = 21.5 km in close agreement with the
quoted value [34]. In the same vein, we may also calculate the inﬂuence of the self-potential on the tidal
range. Since the density of water is ρ1 ≈ 1.0 g cm−3 , the denominator increases the tidal range (7.15) by
merely a factor of 1.12.

(7.31)

The ﬁeld of gravity is orthogonal to the equipotential surface, as it should be.
Note that the three correction terms to the vertical ﬁeld (7.30a) are due to the centrifugal force, to the
change in gravity due to the change in height, and to the displacement of material. All three contributions
are of the same order of magnitude, q, because they all ultimately derive from the centrifugal force.
The variation of g/g0 with latitude δ.

Example 7.4.1 (Olympic games): The dependence of gravity on polar angle (or latitude) given in
(7.30a) has practical consequences. In 1968 the Olympic games were held in Mexico City at latitude
δ = 19 ◦ N whereas in 1980 they were held in Moscow at latitude δ = 55 ◦ N. To compare record
heights in jumps (or throws), it is necessary to correct for the variation in gravity due to the centrifugal
force, the geographical difference in height and air resistance. Assuming that the initial velocity is the
same, the height h attained in Mexico city would correspond to a height h in Moscow, related to h by
v 2 = 2gh = 2g h . Using (7.30a) we ﬁnd h/ h = g /g = 1.00296. This shows that a correction of
−0.3% due to variation in gravity (among other corrections) would have to be applied to the Mexico
City heights before they were compared with the Moscow heights.

One of the main assumptions behind the calculations in this section was that the planet should be slowly

it is fairly obvious, that if the rate of rotation of the planet is increased, the ﬂattening increases until it
reaches a point, where the ‘antigravity’ of rotation overcomes the ‘true’ gravity of planetary matter as well
as cohesive forces. Then the planet becomes unstable with dramatic change of shape or even breakup as a
consequence.
The study of the possible forms of rotating planets was initiated at a very early stage by Newton and
in particular by MacLaurin. It was found that oblate ellipsoids of rotation are possible allowed shapes
for rotating planets with constant matter density, ρ0 . An oblate ellipsoid of rotation is characterized by
equal-size major axes, a = b and a smaller minor axis c < a, about which it rotates.
MacLaurin found that the angular rotation rate is related to the eccentricity e = 1 − c2 /a 2 through
the formula

The right-hand side is shown in ﬁgure 7.2 and has a maximum 0.225 for e = 0.93, implying that stability can
only be maintained for 2 /2π Gρ0 < 0.225. Actually, various other shape instabilities set in at even lower

At the interface between two materials physical properties change rapidly over distances comparable to the
molecular separation scale. The transition layer is, from a macroscopic point of view, an inﬁnitely thin
sheet coinciding with the interface. Although the transition layer in the continuum limit thus appears to
be a mathematical surface, it may nevertheless possess macroscopic physical properties, such as energy.
And where energy is found, forces are not far away. Surface energy is necessarily accompanied by surface
forces, because work has to be performed if the area of an interface and thus its surface energy is increased.
The surface energy per unit of area or equivalently the force per unit of length is called surface tension.
Surface tension depends on the physical properties of both of the interfacing materials, and so is quite
different from other material constants, for example the bulk modulus, that normally depend only on the
physical properties of just one material. Surface tension creates a ﬁnite jump in pressure across the interface,
but the typical magnitude of surface tension limits its inﬂuence to ﬂuid bodies much smaller than the huge
planets and stars discussed in the preceding chapters. When surface tension does come into play, as it does
for a drop of water hanging at the tip of an icicle, the shape of the ﬂuid body bears little relation to the
gravitational equipotential surfaces that dominate large-scale systems. The characteristic length scale at
which surface tension matches standard gravity in strength, the capillary length, is merely three mm for
the water–air interface. This is the length scale of champagne bubbles, droplets of rain, insects walking on
water, and many other phenomena.
In this chapter surface tension is introduced along with the accompanying concept of contact angle, and
applied to the capillary effect, and to bubble and droplet shapes. In chapter 24 we shall study its inﬂuence
on surface waves.

8.1 The Young–Laplace law for surface tension
The apparent paradox that a mathematical surface with no volume can possess energy may be resolved by
considering a primitive three-dimensional model of a material in which the molecules are placed in a cubic
grid with grid length L mol . Each molecule in the interior has six bonds to its neighbours with a total binding
energy of − , but a surface molecule will only have ﬁve bonds when the material interfaces with a vacuum.
The (negative) binding energy of the missing bond is equivalent to an extra positive energy /6 for a surface
molecule relative to an interior molecule, and thus an extra surface energy density,
α≈

The binding energy may be estimated from the speciﬁc enthalpy of evaporation H of the material as
≈ H Mmol /N A . Note that the unit for surface tension is J m−2 = kg s−2 .

Surface energy and surface tension
Increasing the area of the interface by a tiny amount d A, takes an amount of work equal to the surface
energy contained in the extra piece of surface,

Surface tension of some liquids

in units of mN per metre (from
[41]).

L dA

estimate α ≈ 0.12 J m−2 . The measured value of the surface energy for water/air interface is in fact
α ≈ 0.073 J m−2 at room temperature. Less than a factor of two wrong is not a bad estimate at all!

¹

ds
An external force performs the
work d W = ds to stretch the
surface by ds. Since the area
increase is d A = Lds, the force
is = α L. The force per unit of
length, α = /L, is the surface
tension.

d W = α d A.

(8.2)

This is quite analogous to the mechanical work d W = − p d V performed against pressure when the volume
of the system is expanded by d V . But where a volume expansion under positive pressure takes negative
work, increasing the surface area takes positive work. This resistance against extension of the surface shows
that the interface has a permanent internal tension, called surface tension1 which we shall now see equals
the energy density α.
Formally, surface tension is deﬁned as the force per unit of length that acts orthogonally to an imaginary
line drawn on the interface. Suppose we wish to stretch the interface along a straight line of length L by a
uniform amount ds. Since the area is increased by d A = Lds, it takes an amount of work d W = αLds,
= αL, or /L = α. Surface tension is thus
implying that the force acting orthogonally to the line is
identical to the surface energy density. This is also reﬂected in the equality of the natural units for the two
quantities, N m−1 = J m−2 .
Since the interface has no macroscopic thickness, it may be viewed as being locally ﬂat everywhere,
implying that the energy density cannot depend on the macroscopic curvature, but only on the microscopic
properties of the interface. If the interfacing ﬂuids are homogeneous and isotropic—as they normally are—
the value of the surface energy density will be the same everywhere on the surface, although it may vary
with the local temperature. Surface tension depends, as mentioned, on the physical properties of both of the
interfacing materials, which is quite different from other material constants that normally depend only on
the physical properties of just one material.
Fluid interfaces in equilibrium are usually quite smooth, implying that α must always be positive. If
α were negative, the system could produce an inﬁnite amount of work by increasing the interface area
without limit. The interface would fold up like crumbled paper and mix the two ﬂuids thoroughly, instead
of separating them. Formally, one may in fact view the rapid dissolution of ethanol in water as due to
negative interfacial surface tension between the two liquids. The general positivity of α guarantees that
ﬂuid interfaces seek towards the minimal area consistent with the other forces that may be at play, for
example pressure forces and gravity. Small raindrops and champagne bubbles are for this reason nearly
spherical. Larger raindrops are also shaped by viscous friction, internal ﬂow and gravity, giving them a
much more complicated shape.

Surface tension increases the
pressure inside a spherical
droplet or bubble.

Consider a spherical ball of liquid of radius a, for example hovering weightlessly in a spacecraft. Surface
tension will attempt to contract the ball but is stopped by the build-up of an extra pressure p inside the
liquid. If we increase the radius by an amount da we must perform the work d W1 = α d A = αd(4πa 2 ) =
α8πa da against surface tension. This work is compensated for by the thermodynamic work against the
pressure excess d W2 = − p d V = − p 4πa 2 da. In equilibrium there should be nothing to gain,
d W1 + d W2 = 0, leading to,
p=

The pressure excess is inversely proportional to the radius of the sphere.
It should be emphasized that the pressure excess is equally valid for a spherical raindrop in air and a
spherical air bubble in water. A spherical soap bubble of radius a has two spherical surfaces, one from air

to soapy water and one from soapy water to air. Each gives rise to a pressure excess of 2α/a, such that the
total pressure inside a soap bubble is 4α/a larger than outside.
Example 8.1.2: A spherical raindrop of diameter 1 mm has an excess pressure of only about 300 Pa,
which is tiny compared to atmospheric pressure (105 Pa). A spherical air bubble the size of a small
bacterium with diameter 1 µm acquires a pressure excess due to surface tension a thousand times
larger, about 3 atm.
When can we disregard the inﬂuence of gravity on the shape of a raindrop? For a spherical air bubble
or raindrop of radius a, the condition is that the change in hydrostatic pressure across the drop should be
2α/a, where ρ0 is the
negligible compared to the pressure excess due to surface tension, i.e. ρ0 g0 2a
density of water (minus the negligible density of air). Consequently, we require
a

(8.4)

where the critical radius Rc is called the capillary length. It equals 2.7 mm for an air–water interface at
25 ◦ C and 1.9 mm for mercury.

Derivation of the Young–Laplace law
A smooth surface may, at a given point, be intersected with an inﬁnite number of planes containing the
normal to the surface. In each normal plane the intersection is a smooth planar curve which at the given
point may be approximated by a circle centred on the normal. The centre of this circle is called the centre of
curvature and its radius the radius of curvature of the intersection. Usually the radius of curvature is given
a sign depending on which side of the surface the centre of curvature is situated. As the intersection plane
is rotated, the centre of curvature moves up and down the normal between extreme values R1 and R2 of the
signed radius of curvature, called the principal radii of curvature. It may be shown (problem 8.3) that the
corresponding principal intersection planes are orthogonal, and that the radius of curvature along any other
normal intersection may be calculated from the principal radii.
Consider now a small rectangle d 1 × d 2 with its sides aligned with the principal directions, and
let us begin with the assumption that R1 and R2 are positive. In the 1-direction surface tension acts with
two nearly opposite forces of magnitude αd 2 , but because of the curvature of the surface there will be a
resultant force in the direction of the centre of the principal circle of curvature. Each of the tension forces
forms an angle d 1 /2R1 with the tangent, and projecting both on the normal we obtain the total inwards
force 2αd 2 × d 1 /2R1 . Since the force is proportional to the area d 1 d 2 of the rectangle, it represents an
excess in pressure p = α/R1 on the side of the surface containing the centre of curvature. Finally, adding
the contribution from the 2-direction we obtain the Young–Laplace law for the pressure discontinuity due
to surface tension,
p=α

+

.

(8.5)

For the sphere we have R1 = R2 = a and recover the preceding result (8.3). The Young–Laplace law
may be extended to signed radii of curvature, provided it is remembered that a contribution to the pressure
discontinuity is always positive on the side of the surface containing the centre of curvature, otherwise
negative.
Example 8.1.3 (How sap rises in plants): Plants evaporate water through tiny pores on the surface of
their leaves. This creates a hollow air-to-water surface in the shape of a half-sphere of the same diameter
as the pore. Both radii of curvature are negative R1 = R2 = −a because the centre of curvature lies
outside the water, leading to a negative pressure excess in the water. For a pore of diameter 2a ≈ 1 µm
the excess pressure inside the water will be about p ≈ −3 atm, capable of lifting sap through a
height of 30 m. In practice, the lifting height is considerably smaller because of resistance in the
xylem conduits of the plant through which the sap moves. Taller plants and trees need correspondingly
smaller pore sizes to generate sufﬁcient negative pressures, even down to −100 atm! Recent research
has conﬁrmed this astonishing picture (see M. T. Tyree, Nature 423, (2003) 923).

The Rayleigh–Plateau instability
The spontaneous breakup of the jet of water emerging from a thin pipe is a well-known phenomenon (ﬁrst
studied by Savart in 1833), although the physical explanation is not. Plateau found experimentally in 1873
that the breakup begins when the length of the water column is longer than its circumference, and it was
explained theoretically by Lord Rayleigh in 1879 as due to the interplay between pressure and surface
tension. Here we shall verify Plateau’s conclusion in a simple calculation without making a full stability
analysis involving the equations of ﬂuid dynamics.
Consider an inﬁnitely long cylindrical column of incompressible ﬂuid at rest in the absence of gravity
with its axis along the z-axis. If we normalize the pressure outside the cylinder to zero, surface tension will
make it larger inside, p = α/a where a is its radius. This uniform pressure excess will attempt to squeeze
the column uniformly towards a smaller radius, but if the column is inﬁnitely long, it will be impossible to
move the ﬂuid out of the way, which allows us to ignore this problem. What cannot be ignored are local
radial variations r = r (z) that make the column thicker in some places and thinner in others, because then
the amount of ﬂuid to move out of the way will be ﬁnite.
The simplest such variation is a radial wave of wavelength λ and tiny amplitude b
a, described
by r (z) = a − b cos(2π z/λ). At any of its narrowest points, for example z = 0, one principal
radius of curvature is the radius of the cylinder, R1 = a − b, whereas the other radius of curvature is
1/R2 = r (0) = b4π 2 /λ2 , as a geometrical construction shows. Taking into account that its centre of
curvature is outside the ﬂuid, the local pressure excess due to the variation in radius at the constriction thus
becomes,

when expanded to ﬁrst order in b. For λ > 2πa the pressure excess is positive and will tend to squeeze
ﬂuid away from the constriction, but that will only diminish the radius a − b further and again increase the
pressure excess, until the column is cut right through. A column of incompressible ﬂuid is thus unstable
against radial disturbances with wavelength larger than its circumference (see problem 8.2 for an alternative
derivation of the stability condition).

8.2 Contact angle
An interface between two ﬂuids is a two-dimensional surface which makes contact with a solid wall along a
one-dimensional line. Locally the plane of the ﬂuid interface forms a certain contact angle χ with the wall.
For the typical case of a liquid/air interface, χ is normally deﬁned as the angle inside the liquid. Water and
air against glass meet in a small acute contact angle, χ ≈ 0, whereas mercury and air meets glass at an
obtuse contact angle of χ ≈ 140 ◦ . Due to its small contact angle, water is very efﬁcient in wetting many
surfaces, whereas mercury has a tendency to make pearls. It should be emphasized that the contact angle is
extremely sensitive to surface properties, ﬂuid composition, and additives.

Copyright © 2005 IOP Publishing Ltd.

In the household we regularly use surfactants that enable dishwater to wet greasy surfaces on which
it otherwise would tend to pearl. After washing our cars we apply a wax which makes rainwater
pearl and prevents it from wetting the surface, thereby diminishing rust and corrosion.

8.2. CONTACT ANGLE

Figure 8.2. Spider walking on water. Image courtesy David L. Hu, MIT (Hu, Chan and Bush 2003).
The contact angle is a material constant which depends on the properties of all three materials coming
together. Whereas material adhesion can sustain a tension normal to the wall, the tangential tension has to
vanish. This yields an equilibrium relation between the three surface tensions,
α13 = α23 + α12 cos χ.

(8.7)

This relation is, however, not particularly useful because of the sensitivity of χ to surface properties, and it
is better to view χ as an independent material constant.
Example 8.2.1 (Walking on water): Insects capable of walking on the surface of water must ‘wax’
their feet to obtain an obtuse contact angle and avoid getting wet. They are carried by surface tension
(and buoyancy which we disregard here). Denoting by L the length of the total contact perimeter of its
feet with water a crude condition for walking on water is αL > Mg0 where M is its mass. For an insect
with mass M = 10 mg the contact perimeter must be larger than 1.3 mm. The ratio Je = αL/Mg0
which must be larger than unity for anyone who wants to walk on water has been called the Jesus
number [74].

Capillary effect
Water has a well-known tendency to rise above the ambient level in a narrow vertical glass tube which is
lowered into the liquid. Closer inspection reveals that the surface inside the tube is concave. This is called
the capillary effect and is caused by the acute contact angle of water in conjunction with its surface tension
which creates a negative pressure just below the liquid surface, balancing the weight of the raised water
column. Mercury with its obtuse contact angle displays instead a convex surface shape, creating a positive
pressure just below the surface which forces the liquid down to a level where the pressure equals that at the
ambient level.
Let us ﬁrst calculate the effect for an acute angle of contact. At the centre of the tube the radii
of curvature are equal, and since the centre of curvature lies outside the liquid, they are also negative,
R1 = R2 = −R0 where R0 is positive. Hydrostatic balance at the centre of the tube then takes the form
ρ0 g0 h = 2α/R0 where h is the central height, such that
h=

(8.8)

It should be noted that this is an exact relation which does not depend on the surface being spherical. It also
covers the case of an obtuse contact angle by taking R0 to be negative.
When the tube radius a is small compared to Rc , gravity has no effect on the shape, and the surface
may be assumed to be a sphere of radius R0 . A simple geometric construction shows that a = R0 cos χ,

In the limit of inﬁnite tube radius the capillary effect only deforms the liquid surface close to the nearly
ﬂat vertical wall to accommodate the ﬁnite contact angle. Far from the wall the surface is perfectly ﬂat,
and there will be no pressure jump due to surface tension, and consequently no general capillary rise of the
surface above the ambient level. This is an exactly solvable case which nicely illustrates the mathematics
of planar curves.
The rise or drop at the wall may be estimated by a geometric argument of the same kind as at the
end of the preceding section. Assuming that the shape is a circle of radius R, the pressure change due to
surface tension inside the liquid is p = −α/R roughly in the middle at z = d/2. Hydrostatic balance
thus requires ρ0 g0 d/2 ≈ α/R, and since the radius R as before is related by geometry to the depth by
d = R(1 − sin χ), we ﬁnd for an acute angle of contact,
d ≈ Rc 2(1 − sin χ) = 2Rc sin

8.3. CAPILLARY EFFECT AT A VERTICAL WALL

103

Hydrostatic balance
Assuming that the air pressure is constant, p = p0 , the pressure in the liquid just below the surface is
p = p0 + p where p is given by the Young–Laplace law (8.5). Denoting the local geometric radius
of curvature by R we have for an acute angle of contact R1 = −R and R2 = ∞, because the centre of
curvature lies outside the liquid. The pressure is thus negative p = −α/R just below the surface, and the
hydrostatic pressure of the raised surface must balance the drop in pressure, ρ0 g0 z = α/R, everywhere on
2
the surface. Introducing the capillary radius (8.4), this may be written as 1/R = z/Rc , and we ﬁnd from
(8.13)

This equation together with the two deﬁnitions (8.12) determine x, z and θ as functions of s.
There are several different types of solution, depending on the boundary conditions. For the surface
near the wall the boundary conditions are x = 0 and θ = χ − 90 ◦ for s = 0, and z → 0 for s → ∞.
Having obtained the solution we may then determine the depth z = d for x = 0.

The pendulum connection
Since Rc is a constant for the liquid, we may without loss of generality choose the unit of length such that
Rc = 1. Differentiating (8.14) once more with respect to s, we obtain the equation of motion for an inverted
mathematical pendulum,
d2θ
= sin θ.
ds 2

(8.15)

The boundary conditions correspond to the pendulum starting at an angle θ = θ0 = χ − 90 ◦ with velocity
dθ/ds = d, according to (8.14) (for Rc = 1). The depth d must be chosen precisely such that the pendulum
eventually comes to rest in unstable equilibrium at θ = 0.
If the velocity chosen is larger than the depth, the pendulum will continue through the unstable
equilibrium, and the liquid surface will start to rise again. When the pendulum reaches the angle
θ = −θ0 , another vertical wall may be placed there, forming the same angle of contact with the
liquid surface. This is the planar analogue of the capillary effect in a circular tube, but this problem
is not solvable in terms of elementary functions. The periodic pendulum solutions obtained by letting
the pendulum move through stable equilibrium at θ = π correspond to a strip of liquid hanging at
the lower edge of the vertical plate.

Many static interfaces—capillary surfaces in circular tubes, droplets and bubbles—are invariant under
rotation around an axis, allowing us to establish a fairly simple formalism for the shape of the equilibrium
surface.

The capillary surface
For the rising liquid/air capillary surface with acute contact angle, both geometric radii of curvature, R1
and R2 , are positive. Since both centers of curvature lie outside the liquid, the physical radii will be −R1
and −R2 in the Young–Laplace law (8.5). Assuming that the air pressure is constant, hydrostatic balance

where Rc is the capillary constant (8.4). In the second term one must remember that r/θ → R0 for θ → 0.
Together with the two equations (8.18) we have obtained three ﬁrst-order differential equations for r , z
and θ . Since s does not occur explicitly, and since θ grows monotonically with s , one may eliminate s and
instead use θ as the running parameter. Unfortunately these equations cannot be solved analytically, but
given R0 they may be solved numerically with the boundary conditions r = z = 0 for θ = 0. The solutions
are quasi-periodic curves that spiral upwards forever. The physical solution must however stop at the wall
r = a for θ = θ0 = 90 ◦ − χ , and that ﬁxes R0 . The numeric solutions are displayed in ﬁgure 8.3.

Sessile bubbles and droplets
If a horizontal plate (a ‘lid’) is inserted into water, air bubbles may come up against its underside, and
remain stably sitting (sessile) there. The bubbles are pressed against the plate by buoyancy forces that in
addition tend to ﬂatten bubbles larger than the capillary radius. The shape may be obtained from the above
solution to the capillary effect by continuing it to θ0 = 180 ◦ − χ.
Mercury sitting on the upper side of a horizontal plate likewise forms small nearly spherical droplets
which may be brought to merge and form large ﬂat puddles of ‘quick silver’. In this case the geometric
radii of curvature will both be negative while the physical radii of curvature are both positive because the
centers of curvature lie inside the liquid. The formalism is consequently exactly the same as before, except
that the central radius of curvature R0 is now negative. The shapes are nearly the same as for air bubbles,
except for the different angle of contact.
In ﬁgure 8.4 the four sessile conﬁgurations of bubbles and droplets are displayed. The depth approaches
in all cases a constant value for large central radius of curvature R0 , which may be estimated by the same
√
methods as before to be d = Rc 2(1 ± cos χ) for bubbles(+) and droplets(−). Note that the depth of the
water droplet (frame 8.4b) is enlarged by a factor 40. If water really has contact angle χ = 1 ◦ , the maximal
depth of a water droplet on a ﬂat surface is only d = 0.018Rc ≈ 50 µm. This demonstrates how efﬁcient
water is in wetting a surface, because of its small contact angle.

Pending droplets
Whereas sessile droplets in principle can have unlimited size, hanging liquid droplets will fall if they
become too large. Here we shall investigate the shape of a droplet hanging at the end of a thin glass
tube, for example a pipette ﬁtted with a rubber bulb which allows us to vary the pressure. When the bulb
is slowly squeezed, a droplet emerges at the end of the tube and eventually falls when it becomes large
enough.

Assuming that the tube material is very thin, the boundary conditions may be taken to be r = z = θ = 0
for s = 0, because the rounded end of the tube material is able to accommodate any angle of contact.
The condition that the liquid surface must always make contact with the end of the glass tube at r = a

possible to determine the point of instability in a purely hydrostatic calculation, but the Rayleigh–Plateau
result would indicate that it happens when it develops a ‘waist’, even if there are static solutions beyond
this point.
The solutions fall into two classes. If R0 is larger than a certain critical value, R0 > R01 =
0.778876 . . ., the radial distance r (s) will grow monotonically with s, but if R0 < R01 the surface will
be shaped like an old-fashioned bottle with one or more waists. The critical solution at R0 = R01 has a
turning point with vertical tangent, allowing us to locate the critical point by solving r (s) = r (s) = 0.
The result is that at the critical point the curve length is s1 = 1.95863 . . ., the radius a1 = 0.917622 . . . and
the depth d1 = 1.47804 . . ..
In ﬁgure 8.5a is shown the family of shapes for a droplet with tube radius a = 1 > a1 . For large central
radius of curvature R0 the shape is ﬂat, but as R0 diminishes the droplet grows in volume and develops a

‘waist’. It ﬁnally reaches a maximum volume of 5.26Rc , beyond which it cannot pass continuously and
the drop must surely have fallen. In ﬁgure 8.5b is shown a family of shapes for a droplet with tube radius

Force

 
 
   ¹ Tangential

Normal
In ﬂuids at rest pressure is the only contact force. For solids at rest or in motion, and for viscous ﬂuids
in motion, this simple picture is no longer valid. Besides pressure-like forces acting along the normal to a
contact surface, there may also be shear forces acting tangentially to it. In complete analogy with pressure,
the relevant quantity turns out to be the shear stress, deﬁned to be the shear force per unit of area. Friction
forces are always caused by shear stresses.
The two major classes of materials, ﬂuids and solids, react differently to stress. Whereas ﬂuids respond
by ﬂowing, solids respond by deforming. Although the equations of motion in both cases are derived from
Newton’s second law, ﬂuids and solids are in fact so different that they are usually covered in separate
textbooks. In this book, we shall as far as possible maintain a general view of the physics of continuous
systems, applicable to all types of materials.
The integrity of a solid body is largely due to internal elastic stresses, both normal and tangential to
the surfaces they act on. Together they resist deformation of the material and prevent the body from being
pulled apart. Unlike friction, elastic forces do not dissipate energy, and ideally the work done against
elastic forces during deformation may be fully recovered. In reality, some elastic energy will always be lost
because of the emission of sound waves that eventually decay and turn into heat.
In this chapter the emphasis is on the theoretical formalism for contact forces, independent of whether
they occur in solids, ﬂuids, or intermediate forms such as clay or dough. The vector notation used up to this
point is not adequate to the task, because contact forces not only depend on the spatial position but also on
the orientation of the surface on which they act. A collection of nine stress components, called the stress
tensor, was introduced by Cauchy in 1822 to describe the full range of contact forces that may come into
play.

The force on a small piece of
a surface can be resolved by a
normal pressure-like force and a
tangential shear force.

9.1 Friction
The concept of shear stress is best understood through friction, a shear force known to us all. We hardly
think of friction forces, even though all day long we are served by them and do service to them. Friction is
the reason that the objects we hold are not slippery as a piece of soap in the bathtub, but instead allow us to
grab and drag, heave and lift, rub and scrub. Most of the work we do is in fact done against friction, from
stirring the coffee to making ﬁre by rubbing two sticks against each other.

Static and sliding friction
Consider a heavy crate standing on a horizontal ﬂoor. Its weight mg0 acts vertically downwards on the ﬂoor,
which in turn reacts back on the crate with an equal and opposite normal force of magnitude N = mg0 . If
you try to drag the crate along the ﬂoor by applying a horizontal force F, called traction, you may discover
that the crate is so heavy that you are not able to budge it, implying that the force you apply must be fully

The dimensionless constant of proportionality µ0 is called the coefﬁcient of static friction which in our
daily doings may take a quite sizable value, say 0.5 or greater. Its value depends on what materials are in
contact and on the roughness of the contact surfaces.
If you are able to pull with a sufﬁcient strength, the crate suddenly starts to move, but friction will still
be present and you will have to do real work to move the crate any distance. Empirically, the dynamic

(9.1)

It is at ﬁrst sight rather surprising that friction is independent of the size of the contact area. A
crate on legs is as hard to drag as a box without, provided they weigh the same. Since larger weight
generates larger friction, a car’s braking distance will be independent of how heavily it is loaded. In
braking a car it is also best to avoid skidding because the static (rolling) friction is larger than sliding
friction (see problem 9.2). Anti-skid brake systems automatically adjust braking pressure to avoid
skidding and thus minimize braking distance.
The law of sliding friction goes back to Coulomb (1779) (and also Amontons (1699)). The full story
of friction is complicated, and in spite of our everyday familiarity with friction, there is still no universally
accepted microscopic explanation of the phenomenon1 .

9.2 The concept of stress
Shear stress is, just like pressure, deﬁned as force per unit of area, and the standard unit of stress is the
same as the unit for pressure, namely the pascal (Pa = N m−2 ). If a crate on the ﬂoor has a contact area A,
we may speak both about the average normal stress σn = N/A and the average tangential (or shear) stress
σt = T/A that the crate exerts on the ﬂoor. Depending on the mass distribution of the contents of the crate
and the stiffness of its bottom, the local stresses may vary across the contact area A.

External and internal stress
The stresses acting between the crate and the ﬂoor are external and are found in the true interface between
a body and its environment. In analogy with pressure, we shall also speak about internal stresses, even if
we may be unable to deﬁne a practical way to measure them. Internal stresses abound in the macroscopic
world around us. Whenever we come into contact with the environment (and when do we not?) stresses
are set up in the materials we touch, and in our own bodies. The precise distribution of stress in a body
depends not only on the external forces applied to the body, but also on the type of material the body is made
from and on other macroscopic quantities such as temperature. In the absence of external forces there is
usually no stress in a material, although fast cooling may freeze stresses permanently into certain materials,
for example glass, and provoke an almost explosive release of stored energy when triggered by a sudden
impact.

9.2. THE CONCEPT OF STRESS

113

Estimating internal stress
In many situations it is quite straightforward to estimate average stresses in a body. Consider, for example,
a slab of homogeneous solid material bounded by two stiff ﬂat clamps of area A, ﬁrmly glued to it. A
tangential force of magnitude F applied to one clamp with the other held ﬁxed will deform the slab a bit in
the direction of the applied force. Here we shall not worry about how to calculate the deformation of the
slab, but will just assume that the response of the slab is the same throughout, so that there is a uniform
shear stress σ = F/A acting on the surface of the slab.
The ﬁxed clamp will, of course, act back on the slab with a force of the same magnitude but in an
opposite direction. If we make an imaginary cut through the slab parallel with the clamps, then the upper
part of the slab must likewise act on the lower with the shear force F, so that the internal shear stress
acting on the cut must again be σ = F/A. If pressure had also been applied to the clamps, we would have
gone through the same type of argument to convince ourselves that the normal stress would be the same
everywhere in the cut.
For bodies with a more complicated geometry and non-uniform external load, internal stresses are not
so easily calculated, although their average magnitudes may be estimated. In analogy with friction one may
assume that variations in shear and normal stresses are roughly of the same order of magnitude, provided
the material and the body geometry are not exceptional.
Example 9.2.1 (Classic gallows): The classic gallows is constructed from a vertical pole, a horizontal
beam and sometimes a diagonal strut. A body of mass M = 70 kg hangs at the extreme end of the
horizontal beam of cross section A = 100 cm2 . The body’s weight must be balanced by a shear stress
in the beam of magnitude σ ≈ Mg0 /A ≈ 70 000 Pa ≈ 0.7 bar. The actual distribution of shear stress
will vary over the cross section of the beam and the position of the chosen cross section, but its average
magnitude should be of the estimated value.

Example 9.2.2 (Water pipe): The half-inch water mains in your house have an inner pipe radius
a ≈ 0.6 cm. Tapping water at a high rate, internal friction in the water (viscosity) creates shear stresses
opposing the ﬂow, and the pressure drops perhaps by p ≈ 0.1 bar = 104 Pa over a length of L ≈ 10 m
of the pipe. In this case, we may actually calculate the shear stress on the water from the inner surface
of the pipe without estimation errors, because the pressure difference between the ends of the pipe
is the only other force acting on the water. Setting the force due to the pressure difference equal
to the total shear force on the inner surface, we get πa 2 p = 2πaLσ , from which it follows that
σ = p a/2L ≈ 3 Pa. This stress is indeed of the same size as we would have estimated from the
corresponding pressure drop p · a/L over a stretch of pipe of the same length as the radius.

Tensile strength
When external forces grow large, a solid body may fracture and break apart. The maximal tension, i.e.
negative pressure or pull, a material can sustain without fracturing is called the tensile strength of the
material. Similarly, the yield stress is deﬁned as the stress beyond which otherwise elastic solids begin
to undergo permanent deformation. For metals the tensile strength lies typically in the region of several

Shear stress is more complicated than normal stress, because there is more than one tangential direction on
a surface. In a coordinate system where a force d x is applied along the x-direction to a material surface
d S y with its normal in the y-direction, the shear stress will be denoted σx y = d x /d S y , instead of just σ .
Similarly, if the shear force is applied in the z-direction, the stress would be denoted σzy = d z /d S y , and
if a normal force had been applied along the y-direction, it would be consistent to denote the normal stress
σ yy = d y /d S y . By convention, the sign is chosen such that a positive value of σ yy corresponds to a pull
or tension.

Cauchy’s stress hypothesis
Altogether, it therefore appears to be necessary to use at least nine numbers to indicate the state of stress in a
given point of a material in a Cartesian coordinate system. Cauchy’s stress hypothesis (to be proved below)
asserts that the force d = (d x , d y , d z ) on an arbitrary surface element, d S = (d Sx , d S y , d Sz ), is
of the form
d x = σ x x d S x + σ x y d S y + σ x z d Sz ,
d y = σ yx d Sx + σ yy d S y + σ yz d Sz ,
d z = σzx d Sx + σzy d S y + σzz d Sz ,

(9.3)

where each coefﬁcient σi j = σi j (x, t) depends on the position and time, and thus is a ﬁeld in the normal
sense of the word. Collecting them in a matrix



(9.4)
σ = {σi j } = σ yx σ yy σ yz  .
σzx σzy σzz
The force may be written compactly as a matrix equation,
d

= σ · d S.

(9.5)

The force per unit of area is, d /d S = σ · n, where n is the normal to the surface. It is sometimes called
the stress vector, although it is not a vector ﬁeld in the usual sense of the word because it depends on the
normal.

The stress tensor
Together the nine ﬁelds, {σi j }, make up a single geometric object, called the stress tensor, ﬁrst introduced
by Cauchy in 1822. Using index notation, we may write
d i =

σi j d S j .

(9.6)

j

Since the force d i as well as the surface element d Si are vectors, it follows that σi j is indeed a tensor in the
sense of section 2.8 (see problem 2.20). This collection of nine ﬁelds {σi j } cannot be viewed geometrically
as consisting of nine scalar or three vector ﬁelds, but must be considered together as one geometrical object,
a tensor ﬁeld σi j ( x, t) which is neither scalar nor vector. As for ordinary tensors (see section 2.8), there is
unfortunately no simple, intuitive way of visualizing the stress tensor ﬁeld by geometric means.

 

(9.8)
σ x = σ · ex =  y  x.
z
It does not transform under rotation as a true vector because of the factor x on the right-hand side.

Hydrostatic pressure
For the special case of hydrostatic equilibrium, where the only contact force is pressure, comparison of
(9.5) with (4.8) shows that the stress tensor must be
σ = − p 1,

(9.9)

where 1 is the (3 × 3) unit matrix. In tensor notation this becomes
σi j = − p δi j ,

(9.10)

where δi j is the index representation of the unit matrix (2.30).

Mechanical pressure
Generally, however, the stress tensor will have both diagonal and off-diagonal non-vanishing components.
A diagonal component behaves like a (negative) pressure, and one often deﬁnes the pressures along different
coordinate axes to be
px = −σx x ,

p y = −σ yy ,

pz = −σzz .

(9.11)

Since they may be different, it is not clear what the meaning of the pressure in a point should be.
Furthermore, it should be remembered that the diagonal elements of a tensor (σx x , σ yy , σzz ) do not have
a well-deﬁned geometric meaning, and that the quantity ( px , p y , pz ) does not behave like a vector under
Cartesian coordinate transformations (see section 2.8 and problem 2.23).
The mechanical pressure or simply the pressure is deﬁned to be the average of the three pressures along
the axes,
p = 1 ( px + p y + pz ) = − 1 (σx x + σ yy + σzz ).
3
3

(9.12)

This makes sense because the sum over the diagonal elements of a matrix, the trace Tr σ = i σii =
σx x + σ yy + σzz , is invariant under Cartesian coordinate transformations (problem 2.17). Deﬁning pressure
in this way ensures that it is a scalar ﬁeld, taking the same value in all coordinate systems. There is in fact
no other scalar linear combination of the stress components.

z

Example 9.3.2: For the stress tensor given in example 9.3.1 the pressures along the coordinate axes
become px = −x 2 , p y = −y 2 and pz = −z 2 . Evidently, they do not form a vector, but the average
pressure,
p = − 1 (x 2 + y 2 + z 2 ),
3

(9.13)

is clearly a scalar, invariant under rotations of the Cartesian coordinate system.

∗ Proof of Cauchy’s stress hypothesis
As in the proof of Pascal’s law (page 48) we take again a surface element in the shape of a tiny triangle with
area vector d S = (d Sx , d S y , d Sz ). This triangle and its projections on the coordinate planes form together
a little body in the shape of a tetrahedron. Since we aim to prove the existence of the stress tensor, we
cannot assume that it exists. What we know is that the forces acting from the inside of the tetrahedron on
the three triangular faces in the coordinate planes are vectors of the form d x = σ x d Sx , d y = σ y d S y

where w is the acceleration of the tetrahedron, and d M = ρ d V its mass, which is assumed to be constant.
The signs have been chosen in accordance with the inward direction of the area projections d Sx , d S y and
d Sz .
The volume of the tetrahedron scales like the third power of its linear size, whereas the surface areas
only scale like the second power (see section 4.2). Making the tetrahedron progressively smaller, the
body force term and the acceleration term will vanish faster than the surface terms. In the limit of a truly
inﬁnitesimal tetrahedron, only the surface terms survive, so that we must have
d

= σ x d S x + σ y d S y + σ z d Sz .

(9.15)

This shows that the force on an arbitrary surface element may be written as a linear combination of three
basic stress vectors, one for each coordinate axis. Introducing the nine coordinates of the three triplets,
σ x = (σx x , σ yx , σzx ), σ y = (σx y , σ yy , σzy ) and σ z = (σx z , σ yz , σzz ), we arrive at (9.3).

material particle is d = f ∗ d V . As in hydrostatics (page 50) this may be demonstrated by considering a
small box-shaped particle.

Cauchy’s equation of equilibrium
In mechanical equilibrium, the total force on any body must vanish, for if it does not the body will begin to
= 0 for all volumes V . In particular, requiring that the force on
move. So the general condition is that
each and every material particle must vanish, we arrive at Cauchy’s equilibrium equation(s),
fi +

∇ j σi j = 0.

(9.19)

In spite of their simplicity these partial differential equations govern mechanical equilibrium in all kinds
of continuous matter, be it solid, ﬂuid, or whatever. For a ﬂuid at rest where pressure is the only stress
component, we have σi j = − p δi j , and recover the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium, f i − ∇i p = 0.
It is instructive to explicitly write out the three individual equations contained in Cauchy’s equilibrium
equation,
f x + ∇x σx x + ∇ y σx y + ∇z σx z = 0,
f y + ∇x σ yx + ∇ y σ yy + ∇z σ yz = 0,
f z + ∇x σzx + ∇ y σzy + ∇z σzz = 0.

9.4. MECHANICAL EQUILIBRIUM

These equations are in themselves not sufﬁcient to determine the state of continuous matter, but must be
supplemented by suitable constitutive equations connecting stress and state. For ﬂuids at rest, the equation
of state serves this purpose by relating hydrostatic pressure to mass density and temperature (chapter 4).
In elastic solids, the constitutive equations are more complicated and relate stress to displacement (chapter
11).

Ö

Symmetry
There is one very general condition (also going back to Cauchy) which may normally be imposed, namely
the symmetry of the stress tensor
σi j = σ j i .

(9.21)

Symmetry only affects the shear stress components, requiring
σx y = σ yx ,

σ yz = σzy ,

σzx = σx z ,

(9.22)

and thus reduces the number of independent stress components from nine to six.
Being thus a symmetric matrix, the stress tensor may be diagonalized. The eigenvectors deﬁne the
principal directions of stress and the eigenvalues the principal tensions or stresses. In the principal
basis, there are no off-diagonal elements, i.e. shear stresses, only pressures. The principal basis is
generally different from point to point in space.

Proof of symmetry: There is in fact no general proof of symmetry of the stress tensor, but only some
theoretical arguments that allow us to choose the stress tensor to be symmetric in all normal materials. These
arguments are presented in section 9.5. Here we shall present a simple argument, only valid in complete
mechanical equilibrium.
Consider a material particle in the shape of a tiny rectangular box with sides a, b and c. The force acting
in the y-direction on a face in the x-plane is σ yx bc whereas the force acting in the x-plane on a face in the
y-plane is σx y ac. On the opposite faces the contact forces have opposite sign in mechanical equilibrium
(their difference is as we have seen of order abc). Since the total force vanishes, the total moment of force
on the box may be calculated around any point we wish. Using the lower left corner, we get

Åz = a σ yx bc − b σx y ac = (σ yx − σx y )abc.
This shows that if the stress tensor is asymmetric, σx y = σ yx , there will be a resultant moment on the
box. In mechanical equilibrium this cannot be allowed, since such a moment would begin to rotate the box,
and consequently the stress tensor must be symmetric. Conversely, when the stress tensor is symmetric,
mechanical equilibrium of the forces alone guarantees that all local moments of force will vanish.

Boundary conditions
Cauchy’s equation of equilibrium constitutes a set of coupled partial differential equations, and such
equations require boundary conditions. The stress tensor is a local physical quantity, or rather collection of
quantities, and may, like pressure in hydrostatics, be assumed to be continuous in regions where material
properties change continuously. Across real boundaries, interfaces, where material properties may change
abruptly, Newton’s third law only demands that the stress vector, σ · n = { j σi j n j }, be continuous across
a surface with normal n (in the absence of surface tension). This does not mean that all the components of
the stress tensor should be continuous. Since Newton’s third law is a vector condition, it imposes continuity
on three linear combinations of stress components, but leaves for the symmetric stress tensor three other
combinations free to jump discontinuously. Surprisingly, it does not follow that the pressure (9.12) is
continuous. In full-ﬂedged continuum theory, the pressure in fact loses the appealing intuitive meaning it
acquired in hydrostatics.
Example 9.4.1: Consider a plane interface in the yz-plane. The stress components σx x , σ yx and
σzx must then be continuous, because they specify the stress vector on such a surface. Symmetry
implies that σx y and σx z are likewise continuous. The remaining three independent components
σ yy , σzz and σ yz = σzy are allowed to jump at the interface. In particular the average pressure,
p = −(σx x + σ yy + σzz )/3, may be discontinuous.

Only the three components of
the stress vector need to be
continuous at the interface.

If the stress tensor is manifestly asymmetric, we shall now show that it is always possible to make it
symmetric by exploiting an ambiguity in its deﬁnition. The argument which will now be presented is
adapted from P. C. Martin, O. Parodi and P. S. Pershan, Phys. Rev. A6, (1972) 2401 (also used in [37, p.
7]).

The ambiguous stress tensor
The stress tensor was introduced at the beginning of this chapter as a quantity which furnished a complete
description of the contact forces that may act on any surface element. But surface elements are not in
themselves physical bodies. We can only determine the magnitude and direction of a force by observing its
inﬂuence on the motion of a real physical body having a volume V and a closed surface S. The resultant
of all contact forces acting on the surface of a body is given by (9.17), showing that the relevant quantity
for the dynamics of continuous matter is the contribution j ∇ j σi j to the effective density of force rather
than the stress tensor σi j itself.
Two stress tensors, σi j and σi j , are therefore physically indistinguishable, if they give rise to the same
effective density of force everywhere. This is, for example, the case if we write
σi j = σi j +

∇k χi j k

(9.23)

k

where χi j k is antisymmetric in j and k,
χi j k = −χikj .

(9.24)

For then
∇ j σi j =
j

∇ j σi j +
j

∇ j ∇k χi j k =
jk

∇ j σi j ,
j

where the last term in the middle vanishes because of the symmetry of the double derivatives and the
assumed antisymmetry of χi j k .
It remains to show that there exists a tensor χi j k such that σi j becomes symmetric. Let us put
χi j k = ∇i φ j k + ∇ j φik − ∇k φi j

(9.25)

where φi j is an antisymmetric tensor, φi j = −φ j i . Evidently this choice of χi j k has the right symmetry
properties (9.24). Inserting it into (9.23) we obtain
∇k (∇i φ j k + ∇ j φik ) − ∇ 2 φi j .

σi j = σi j +
k

The tensor φi j is now chosen to be a solution to Poisson’s equation with the antisymmetric part of the
original stress tensor as source,
∇ 2 φi j = 1 (σi j − σ j i ).
2

(9.26)

Such a solution can in principle always be found, and then we obtain
σi j = 1 (σi j + σ j i ) +
2

∇k (∇i φ j k + ∇ j φik )

(9.27)

which is manifestly symmetric. Notice, however, that the new symmetric stress tensor is not just the
symmetric part of the old, but contains extra terms.

Non-classical continuum theories
The conclusion is, that if somebody presents you with a stress tensor which is asymmetric, you may always
replace it by a suitable symmetric stress tensor, having exactly the same physical consequences.
But even if it is formally possible to choose a symmetric stress tensor, it may not always be convenient,
because of the non-locality inherent in the solution to Poisson’s equation in (9.26). Asymmetric stress
tensors have been used in various generalizations of classical continuum theory, containing elementary
volume and surface densities of moments (body couples and couple stresses) and sometimes also intrinsic
angular momentum (spin). We shall not go further into these non-classical extensions of continuum theory
here; so-called micropolar materials are, for example, discussed in [51, p. 493].

All materials deform when subjected to external forces, but different materials react in different ways.
Elastic materials bounce back again to the original conﬁguration when the forces cease to act. Others are
plastic and retain their shape after deformation. Viscoelastic materials behave like elastic solids under fast
deformation, but creep like viscous liquid over longer periods of time. Elasticity is itself an idealization,
limited to a certain range of forces. If the external forces become excessive, all materials become plastic
and undergo permanent deformation, even fracture.
When a body is deformed, the material is displaced away from its original position. Small deformations
are mathematically much easier to handle than large deformations, where parts of a body become greatly
and non-uniformly displaced relative to other parts, as for example when you crumple a piece of paper. A
rectilinear coordinate system embedded in the original body and deformed along with the material of the
body becomes a curvilinear coordinate system after the deformation. It can therefore come as no surprise
that the general theory of ﬁnite deformation is mathematically at the same level of difﬁculty as general
curvilinear coordinate systems. Luckily, our buildings and machines are rarely subjected to such violent
treatment, and in most practical cases the deformation may be assumed to be tiny.
The description of continuous deformation inevitably leads to the introduction of a new tensor quantity,
the strain tensor, which characterizes the state of local deformation or strain in a material. Strained relations
between neighbouring material particles cause tension or stress—as they do among people. In this chapter
we shall focus exclusively on the description of strain, and postpone the discussion of the stress-strain
relationship for elastic materials to chapter 11.

10.1 Displacement
The prime example of deformation is a uniform dilatation, in which the coordinates of every material
particle in a body are multiplied by a constant factor, κ > 1. Under a dilatation a material particle originally
situated in the point x is displaced to the point,
x = κ x.

(10.1)

Note that both x and x refer to the same coordinate system. Contraction is also included for κ-values in
the interval 0 < κ < 1. Negative values of κ are physically impossible for macroscopic bodies, because
they contain a reﬂection (x = −x) in the origin of the coordinate system. Although you can see your own
reﬂection in a mirror, the reﬂection cannot be realized physically.
The only point which does not change place during a uniform dilatation is the origin of the coordinate
system. Although it superﬁcially looks as if the origin of the coordinate system plays a special
role, this is not really the case. All relative positions of material particles scale in the same way,
x − y = κ(x − y), independent of the origin of the coordinate system. There is no special centre

122

10. STRAIN
for a uniform dilatation, either geometrically or physically. The origin of the coordinate system is
simply an anchor point for the mathematical description of dilatation.

The displacement ﬁeld
Under a deformation the centre of mass of a material particle is displaced from its original position x to
its actual position x . The displacement u = x − x depends on the particle’s position and is thus a ﬁeld
u = u(x) in its own right, called the displacement ﬁeld. Given the displacement ﬁeld, we may calculate the
new position,
x = x + u(x).

(10.2)

For the dilatation (10.1) the displacement ﬁeld becomes u(x) = (κ − 1) x.
There are actually two equivalent ways of choosing a ﬁeld to represent the displacement as a function
of the particle positions. In the Lagrange representation used here the displacement x − x = u(x)
is understood as a function of the original position x. In the Euler representation the displacement
x − x = u (x ) is understood as a function of the actual position x . The two representations
represent of course the same displacement, so that u (x ) = u(x). Conceptually and mathematically,
the Lagrange representation is more convenient for the theory of small elastic deformations. The
Euler representation is on the other hand more physical, because the displacement ﬁeld at a given
point represents the state of the material actually found in that position. For small and smooth
displacement ﬁelds there is very little difference between the Euler and the Lagrange representations.

Small displacements
The transformation (10.2) is for general u(x) a completely arbitrary vector mapping, x → x = f (x) =
x + u(x). The only reason to split off the displacement ﬁeld, and not work with the mapping function
f (x) itself, is that the displacement always will be assumed to be ‘small’. Since u(x) is a quantity with
dimension of length, there is no absolute meaning to ‘small’. But in a body of size L, the ﬁrst term in (10.2)
will change by L as the position x ranges over the body, and this allows us to deﬁne a displacement to be
small, if for all x,

(10.3)

In the following we shall always assume that the displacement is small, except for section 10.5 where the
generalization to ﬁnite displacements that do not fulﬁll this condition is brieﬂy outlined.

Linear displacements
A general displacement includes all kinds of ordinary rigid body translations and rotations, and it would be
wrong to classify such displacements as deformations. Sailing a submarine at the surface of the water will
only displace it, not deform it, whereas taking it to the bottom of the sea will deform it (slightly). A real
deformation must involve changes in geometric relationships, i.e. lengths and angles, in the body.
Although the displacement in general will be a nonlinear function of the coordinates, we shall begin
by analysing linear displacements akin to the uniform dilatation (10.1). In the most general case, a linear
displacement ﬁeld takes the form
u(x) = A · x + b.

(10.4)

where A is a constant matrix and b is a constant vector. There is strong similarity between the class of
linear displacements and the transformations of Cartesian coordinates discussed in section 2.7, but the class
of linear displacements is larger, because the underlying coordinate transformation is not restricted to be
orthogonal. The conceptual difference lies in the interpretation of the displacement ﬁeld, which represents
a physical shift of the material, as opposed to a change in the way the coordinates are calculated.
The general linear displacement may also be resolved into simpler types, namely translation along a
coordinate axis, rotation by a ﬁxed angle around a coordinate axis, and scaling by a ﬁxed factor along a
coordinate axis. The physically impossible reﬂections are excluded. We shall not prove here that the general
linear displacement may be resolved in this way, but instead rely on geometric intuition.

10.2 Local deformation
Displacement is, as demonstrated by the linear examples, not the same as deformation. All the parts of
a body could be simultaneously displaced by the same amount, or bodily rotated, without altering the
geometric relations between them. What is needed is a measure of the actual change of spatial relations
between different parts of the material, also called strain.
Large scale deformation can be very complex. Think of all the loops and knots that weavers make from
a roll of yarn. We should for this reason not expect to ﬁnd a simple formalism for global deformation.
Weaving, folding, winding, writhing, wringing and squashing may bring particles that were originally far
apart into close proximity. Even the wildest weave consists, however, locally of small pieces of straight
yarn that have only been translated, rotated, stretched or contracted, but not folded, spindled or mutilated.
We may therefore expect to ﬁnd a much simpler description of deformation for very small pieces of matter.

Displacement of a tiny material
needle from a to a . It may be
translated, rotated, and dilated.
Only the latter corresponds to a
true deformation.

Displacement of a ‘needle’
Consider a tiny elongated piece of matter, a material vector or ‘needle’, connecting a point x with the point
x + a. After displacement this needle connects the points x = x + u(x) and x + a = x + a + u(x + a),
and solving for a we ﬁnd
a = a + u(x + a) − u(x).

(10.10)

The needle is now assumed to be so small that we may expand the displacement ﬁeld u(x + a) to ﬁrst order
in a. For the x-component of the ﬁeld, we ﬁnd
u x (x + a) ≈ u x (x) + ax

∂u x (x)
∂u x (x)
∂u x (x)
+ ay
+ az
∂x
∂y
∂z

= u x (x) + (a · ∇)u x (x).
Since a · ∇ is a scalar operator acting in the same way on each component of a vector, we may collect the
other components and write the original vector for an inﬁnitesimal needle in the form
a = a + (a · ∇) u(x).

(10.11)

Not surprisingly, since it is a relation between inﬁnitesimal quantities, this transformation is linear in a. In
index notation, it may be written as,
ai = ai +

(∇ j u i )a j .

(10.12)

j

This shows that the coefﬁcients of the linear transformation of a are computed from the derivatives of the
displacement ﬁeld, ∇ j u i , also called the displacement gradients. For a general linear displacement (10.4)
we have ∇ j u i = A i j .
Example 10.2.1: The displacement gradient matrix of a simple rotation (10.7) is,


−1 + cos φ
− sin φ
0
{∇ j u i } =  sin φ
−1 + cos φ 0

(10.13)

where the index i enumerates the rows and j the columns. If the angle of rotation is small, |φ|
1, the
displacement gradients are all small, and the matrix becomes,


0 −φ 0
0
0
(10.14)
{∇ j u i } = φ
0

to lowest order in φ.

Small displacement gradients
Since both displacements and coordinates have dimension of length, the displacement gradients are all
dimensionless quantities, i.e. pure numbers, and this makes it meaningful to speak of small displacement
gradients in an absolute way. We shall say that a displacement ﬁeld is slowly varying or smooth, if all the
displacement gradients are small everywhere, i.e. ∇ j u i (x)
1 for all i, j and x. In terms of the matrix
of displacement gradients, ∇u = {∇ j u i }, this may equivalently be written as a condition on the matrix
norm (2.17),
|∇u(x)|

1,

(10.15)

for all x in a body.
A small displacement gradient does not automatically imply that the displacement itself is small
compared to the size of the body, because the displacement could include a rigid body translation to the
other end of the universe which would not affect its gradient. But relative to a ﬁxed anchor point in the body

125

which is not displaced, a slowly varying ﬁeld must always be small compared to the size of the body and
thus fulﬁll (10.3). A displacement ﬁeld satisfying this condition everywhere will in general also be slowly
varying, though there are notable exceptions. If you, for example, make a crease in your shirt when you
iron it, the displacement gradients will be almost inﬁnitely large in the crease although none of the shirt’s
material is greatly displaced compared to the size of the shirt.
Except for section 10.5, where a few aspects of the theory of ﬁnite deformations are presented, we shall
from now on assume that the displacement ﬁeld is both small and smooth. In that case the change in a
needle vector,
δ a ≡ a − a = ( a · ∇)u,
is also small compared to the length of a, i.e. |δ a|

Cauchy’s strain tensor
Since the scalar product of two needles a · b is unchanged by translation and rotation, it ought to be a
useful indicator for a change in geometry. Using (10.16), we calculate the change in the scalar product
δ(a · b) ≡ a · b − a · b to ﬁrst order in the small displacement gradients
δ(a · b) = δ a · b + a · δ b

The change in a needle vector
is small when the displacement
gradients are small.

is the symmetric combination of displacement gradients, called Cauchy’s strain tensor (or just the strain
tensor when that is unambiguous). The strain tensor contains all the information about geometric changes
in the displacement. It must, however, be emphasized that the above expression is only valid for small
displacement gradients. For ﬁnite displacement gradients, a more complicated expression must be used
(see section 10.5).
It pays to write out all the components of the strain tensor explicitly, once and for all. On the diagonal,
they are
u x x = ∇x u x ,

u yy = ∇ y u y ,

u zz = ∇z u z ,

(10.19)

whereas off the diagonal,
u x y = u yx = 1 (∇x u y + ∇ y u x )
2
u yz = u zy = 1 (∇ y u z + ∇z u y )
2

(10.20)

u zx = u x z = 1 (∇z u x + ∇x u z )
2
Had we not assumed that the displacement was slowly varying, there would also have been quadratic terms
in the displacement gradients, and the strain tensor might take large values. But with our assumption of
small displacement gradients (10.15), the strain tensor ﬁeld is likewise small, u i j (x)
1 for all i, j and
x.
Example 10.2.2 (Simple translation): The displacement gradients of a bodily translation, u(x) = b,
vanishes trivially, and so does the strain tensor. This conﬁrms that a translation is not a deformation.

antisymmetric. Cauchy’s strain tensor, which is the symmetric part of this matrix, vanishes, conﬁrming
that a rotation is not a deformation.

Principal basis of deformation of

and rotation, this basis is only
subject to scale changes along the
principal axes.

(10.23)

It differs in this respect from the stress tensor, which for symmetry required further assumptions (see section
9.5). The symmetry implies that the strain tensor may be diagonalized at every point. The eigenvectors of
the strain tensor at a given point are called the principal axes of strain, and form an orthonormal basis at
every point. Whereas the angles between the principal axes are unchanged under the displacement, the
signs and magnitudes of the eigenvalues determine how much the material is being stretched or contracted
along the principal axes. It should, however, be remembered that the principal basis varies from point to
point in space.

10.3 Geometrical meaning of the strain tensor
The strain tensor contains all the relevant information about changes in geometric relationships, such as
lengths of material needles and the angles between them. Other geometric quantities, for example volume,
are also changed under a deformation.

Changes in lengths and angles
It is useful for the following discussion to deﬁne the projection u ab of a tensor u i j on the directions of two
arbitrary vectors a and b,
u ab =

i j u i j ai b j

|a| |b|

.

(10.24)

Then we may simply write,
δ(a · b) = 2 |a| |b| u ab ,
for the change in a scalar product (10.17).

(10.25)

10.3. GEOMETRICAL MEANING OF THE STRAIN TENSOR
Change in length: The change in length of a needle is obtained by setting b = a in (10.25), and using
that 2 |a| δ |a| = δ(a2 ) = 2 |a|2 u aa we get,
a − |a|
δ |a|
≡
= u aa .
|a|
|a|

(10.26)

The diagonal strain projection u aa is thus the fractional change of lengths in the direction a. Obtaining this
relation is the reason behind the conventional factor 2 in the deﬁnition (10.18) of the strain tensor.

Õ

127

Ö Ö

The change in length δ |a| is determined by the diagonal projection of the strain tensor.

δ(a · b) = δ |a| |b| cos φab + |a| δ |b| cos φab − |a| |b| sin φab δφab .
Solving for δφab , we obtain by means of (10.25) and (10.26)
δφab ≡ φab − φab = −

2u ab
+ (u aa + u bb ) cot φab .
sin φab

(10.27)
δφab

For φab → 0 the vectors become parallel and the expression diverges, but the divergence is only apparent
because u aa = u bb = u ab for parallel vectors. For originally orthogonal vectors, such as the coordinate
axes, we have φab = π/2, and the change in angle simpliﬁes to
δφab = −2u ab .

(10.28)

The off-diagonal projections of the strain tensor thus determine the change in angle between originally
orthogonal needles.

Change in volume and density
Under a displacement all the material particles in a volume V are simultaneously moved to ﬁll out another
volume V which for small displacements lies in the vicinity of the original volume. The smallness of the
displacement permits us to calculate the change in volume from the small displacement of its surface S.
Since a surface element d S at x is displaced through the vector distance u(x), it scoops up a tiny volume
u(x) · d S (counted with sign), so that the total change in the volume V becomes,
δV = V − V =

S

u · d S.

(10.29)

Converting the surface integral into a volume integral by means of Gauss’ theorem (6.4), we obtain,
δV =

V

∇ · u d V.

(10.30)

This shows that we may equivalently think of the change in volume V as the sum of the local volume
changes, δ(d V ) = ∇ · u d V , of each and every material particle contained in V . Dividing this equation by
d V we get,
δ(d V )
= ∇ · u,
dV

(10.31)

saying that the local fractional volume change equals the divergence of the smooth displacement ﬁeld.
The change in volume of a material particle induces a change in the local density of the displaced
matter. Since the displacement does not change the mass of a material particle, we ﬁnd,
δ(d M) = δ(ρd V ) = ρ δ(d V ) + δρ d V = 0,
and making use of (10.31) the change in density becomes,
δρ ≡ ρ − ρ = −ρ∇ · u.

10. STRAIN
The fractional change in density δρ/ρ is equal to minus the divergence of the smooth displacement ﬁeld. If
the divergence vanishes, there is no change of volume or density associated with the deformation.
Example 10.3.1: A translation u = b does not change the density. Likewise for an inﬁnitesimal
rotation around the z-axis through a small angle φ where u = (−y, x, 0)φ, has vanishing divergence.
A dilatation u = k x has δρ/ρ = −3k. If k > 0 the volume increases and the density diminishes as it
should with a contribution k from each dimension.

∗ 10.4 Work and energy
Deforming a body takes work, a fact known to everyone who has ever kneaded clay or dough. In these
cases, the work you perform seems to be lost inside the material, but in other cases, as for example when
you squeeze an elastic rubber ball, the material appears to store the work and release it again when you
relinquish your grip. Many ball games like Ping-Pong or tennis rely entirely on the elasticity of the ball. No
material is, however, perfectly elastic. Some energy is always lost to sound waves that are radiated away
and eventually degenerate to heat. A hard steel ball may jump many times on a hard ﬂoor, but eventually it
loses all its energy and comes to rest, partly due to air resistance, partly due to losses in the ball and, perhaps
more importantly, in the ﬂoor. But even when your work seems to get lost in the dough, this is not really the
case. The energy you have put into the clay has in the end been converted into heat which, however, cannot
easily be recovered.
In continuum physics it can be quite subtle to derive the correct energy relations. The simplest way to
proceed is to follow the work, as we did in the qualitative argument above. This is quite analogous to the
admonition, ‘follow the money’, often used with success to uncover economic or political fraud.

Every material particle can be
kept in place by acting on
it with an additional external
force that balances the already
existing effective body force on
the particle.

Suppose we act on the external surface S of a body with some distribution of contact forces under our
control, as we for example do when we knead dough. Any mechanical system that is not in equilibrium, is
(literally) forced to move. If we nevertheless wish to keep it in place in one particular non-equilibrium state,
we must act on its material with an extra volume distribution of external forces, f = − f ∗ , to compensate
for the effective internal forces f ∗ acting on the material particles. This procedure freezes the system in
any desired state for any length of time, and is quite analogous to what we did to determine the potential
energy in a gravitational ﬁeld in section 3.5 on page 38.
Imagine now that the material of the body is displaced by an inﬁnitesimal displacement ﬁeld, δu =
δu(x), perhaps on top of an already existing displacement. The work of all the external forces under this
so-called virtual displacement is then,
δW = −

In a ﬁeld of gravity this work contributes to the gravitational energy of the body, because the potential

( x) d M ≈ −g · δ u d M = −δ u · f d V

internal stresses in the body,

Here we have in the second step used the (assumed) symmetry of the stress tensor to express the integrand
in terms of the inﬁnitesimal change in the strain tensor δ u i j = 1 (∇i δ u j + ∇ j δ u i ). Evidently this work is
2
associated with deformation of the material and contributes to the deformation energy of the body.
In the special case that the stresses are only due to pressure, σi j = − pδi j , the deformation work
becomes
δ Wdeform = −

V

p ∇ · δ u d V.

(10.37)

Since δ(d V ) = ∇ · δ u d V is the change in volume of a material particle, we see that the deformation work
is identical to the local thermodynamic work − p δ(d V ) integrated over all material particles. This conﬁrms
the interpretation of δ Wdeform as the part of the virtual work spent on deforming the body.
In chapter 11 we shall ﬁnd explicit expressions for the gravitational and deformation energies. In
chapter 22 energy balance is discussed without using the concept of virtual work.

∗ 10.5 Finite deformations
When the condition (10.15) for slowly varying displacement is not fulﬁlled, we can no longer use the simple
Cauchy strain tensor (10.18). The local description of ﬁnite deformation (see for example [27]) is essentially
equivalent to the formalism of general curvilinear coordinate systems, but because space is Euclidean the
description is not quite as complicated as that of truly non-Euclidean spaces.
Although many aspects of ﬁnite deformation theory were developed in the nineteenth century, the
subject was not fully established until the mid twentieth century through Rivlin’s work on nonlinear
materials. Here we shall only touch brieﬂy on the most general aspects of ﬁnite deformation theory which
is a mathematically rather difﬁcult subject [17, 26].

The Lagrange representation
In the Lagrange representation a ﬁnite displacement is simply an arbitrary mapping of the original position
of the material before the displacement to the actual position after the displacement,
x → x = f (x) ≡ x + u(x).

(10.38)

There is in fact no reason to split off a special displacement ﬁeld u(x), and we shall only do so to keep
contact with the preceding analysis.
The global mapping of coordinates is considerably simpliﬁed in inﬁnitesimal regions of space, where
the local mapping is described by the differential transformation,

which is what we called the transformation of a ‘needle’ in section 10.2. The matrix of derivatives ∂ xi /∂ x j

The length of the deformed (Cartesian) differential d x may then be written as a double sum,

origin.
The scalar product of two needles then becomes,
a · b = κ 2 a · b,

(10.47)

and just reﬂects that all vectors are scaled by the same amount κ.

The Euler representation
In the Euler representation, the displacement ﬁeld is deﬁned from the mapping of the actual position x to
the original coordinates x,
x → x = f (x ) ≡ x − u (x ).

(10.48)

When you bend a stick the reaction grows notably stronger the further you go—until it perhaps breaks with
a snap. If you release the bending force before it breaks, the stick straightens out again and you can bend it
again and again without it changing its reaction or its shape. That is elasticity.
In elementary mechanics the elasticity of a spring is expressed by Hooke’s law which says that the
force necessary to stretch or compress a spring is proportional to how much it is stretched or compressed.
In continuous elastic materials Hooke’s law implies that stress is a linear function of strain. Some materials
that we usually think of as highly elastic, for example rubber, do not obey Hooke’s law except under very
small deformations. When stresses grow large, most materials deform more than predicted by Hooke’s law.
The proper treatment of nonlinear elasticity goes beyond the simple linear elasticity which we shall discuss
in this book.
The elastic properties of continuous materials are determined by their underlying molecular structure,
but the relation between material properties and the molecular structure and arrangement in solids is
complicated, to say the least. Luckily, there are broad classes of materials that may be described by
a few material parameters which can be determined by macroscopic experiments. The number of such
parameters depends on the complexity of the crystalline structure of the material, but we shall almost
exclusively concentrate on the properties of structureless, isotropic elastic materials, described by just two
material constants, Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio.
In this chapter, the emphasis will be on matters of principle. We shall derive the basic equations of
linear elasticity, but only solve them in the simplest possible cases. In chapter 12 we shall solve these
equations in generic situations of more practical interest.

11.1 Hooke’s law
Ideal massless elastic springs obeying Hooke’s law are a mainstay of elementary mechanics. If a relaxed
spring of length L is anchored at one end and pulled in the other with a force , its length is increased to
L + x. Hooke’s law states that there is proportionality between force and change in length,

Young’s modulus
Real springs are physical bodies with mass, shape and internal molecular structure. Almost any solid body,
anchored at one end and pulled at the other, will react like a spring, when the pull is not too strong. Basically,
this reﬂects that interatomic forces are approximately elastic, when the atoms are only displaced slightly
away from their positions (problem 11.1). Many elastic bodies that we handle daily, for example rubber

bands, piano wire, sticks or water hoses, are long string-like objects with constant cross section, typically
made from homogeneous and isotropic material without any particular internal structure. Their uniform
composition and simple form make material strings convenient models for real springs.
The force necessary to extend the length of a real string by a small amount x must be proportional
to the area, A, of the string cross section, because if we bundle N such such strings loosely together to
make a thicker string of area N A, the total force will have to be N in order to get the same change of
length. This shows that the relevant quantity to speak about is not the force itself, but rather the (average)
normal stress or tension, σx x = N /N A = /A, which is independent of the number of substrings N
acts on any cross section
and consequently of the size A of the cross section. Since the same force
of the string, the string tension σx x must be the same at each point along the string. For a smaller slice
of the string of length L < L, the uniformity implies that it will be stretched proportionally less, i.e.
x /L = x/L. This indicates that the relevant parameter is not the absolute change of length x but rather
the relative longitudinal extension or strain u x x = x/L, which is independent of the length L of the string.
Putting everything together, we conclude that the quantity,
E=

must be independent of both the length L of the spring, the area A of its cross section, and the extension

modulus we may calculate the actual spring constant,
A

(11.3)
L
for any string of length L and cross section A made from this particular material.
Young’s modulus characterizes the behaviour of the material of the spring, when stretched in one
direction. The relation (11.2) also tells us that a unidirectional tension σx x creates a relative extension,
σx x
ux x =

(11.4)
E
in the material. Evidently, Hooke’s law leads to a linear relation between stress and strain, and materials
with this property are generally called linear.
Young’s modulus is by way of its deﬁnition (11.2) measured in units of pressure, and typical values
for metals are, like the bulk modulus (4.33), of the order of 1011 Pa = 1 Mbar. In the same way as the
bulk modulus is a measure of the incompressibility of a material, Young’s modulus is a measure of the
instretchability. The larger it is, the harder it is to stretch the material. In order to obtain a large strain
u x x ≈ 100%, one would have to apply stresses of magnitude σx x ≈ E, as shown by (11.4). Such strains
are, of course, not permitted in the theory of small deformations, but Young’s modulus nevertheless sets the
scale.
k=E

Example 11.1.1 (Rope pulling contest): At company outings, employees often play the game of
pulling in teams at each end of a rope. Before the inevitable terminal instability sets in, there is often a
prolonged period where the two teams pull with almost equal force . If the teams each consist of 10
persons, all pulling with about their average weight of 70 kg, the total force becomes = 7000 N. For
a rope diameter of 5 cm, the stress becomes quite considerable, σx x ≈ 3.6 MPa. For a reasonable value
of Young’s modulus, say E = 36 MPa, the rope will stretch by u x x ≈ 10%.

Poisson’s ratio
Normal materials will contract in directions transverse to the direction of extension. If the transverse size,
the ‘diameter’ D of a string changes by y, the transverse strain becomes of the order of u yy = y/D, and
will in general be negative for a positive stretching force . In linear materials, the transverse strain is also
proportional to , so that the ratio u yy /u x x will be independent of . The negative of this ratio is called
Poisson’s ratio (1829)1 ,

and is another parameter characterizing isotropic materials. It is dimensionless, and typical values lie around
0.30 in metals. We shall see below that it cannot exceed 0.5 in isotropic materials.
Whereas longitudinal extension can be understood as a consequence of elastic atomic bonds being
stretched, it is harder to understand why materials should contract transversally. The reason is, however,
that in an isotropic material there are atomic bonds in all directions, and when bonds that are not purely
longitudinal are stretched, they create a transverse tension which can only be relieved by contracting the
material.
A ladder constructed from ideal springs, with rungs orthogonal to the sides, will not experience a
transverse contraction when stretched. If, on the other hand, some of the rungs are skew (making
the ladder unusable), they will be stretched along with the ladder. But that will necessarily generate
forces that tend to contract the ladder, i.e. a negative transverse tension, which either has to be
balanced by external forces or relieved by contraction of the ladder.

11.2 Hooke’s law in isotropic materials
For a stretched string-like object laid out along the x-direction of the coordinate system, the only nonvanishing stress component is a tension P along x,
σx x = P.

From (11.4) and (11.5) we obtain the corresponding diagonal strain components,

All the shear strains vanish, u x y = u yz = u zx = 0, in this coordinate system.
In an arbitrary coordinate system, the components of the strain tensor will be completely mixed up with
each other, as illustrated by the simple rotation (2.89), and there will also arise shear stresses and strains,
but the relation between the stress tensor and the strain tensor will still be linear. To determine the form of
the most general linear relationship between stress and strain in an isotropic material, we note that in such a
material there are no internal directions which can be used to construct a linear relation between the tensors
σi j and u i j . In that case only two tensors can appear in the relation: one is the strain tensor u i j itself,
another is the Kronecker delta δi j multiplied with the trace of the strain tensor k u kk . This is the only
possible factor, because the trace is the only scalar quantity that can be formed from a linear combination
of the strain tensor components.
Thus, we conclude that the most general strictly linear tensor relation between stress and strain tensors
in an isotropic material is of the form (Cauchy 1822; Lam´ 1852),

which is the generalization of Hooke’s law to arbitrary isotropic materials. The coefﬁcients λ and µ are
material constants, called elastic moduli or Lam´ coefﬁcients. The coefﬁcient λ has no special name,
e
whereas µ is called the shear modulus or the modulus of rigidity, because it controls the magnitude of
shear (off-diagonal) stresses. Since the strain tensor is dimensionless, the Lam´ coefﬁcients are, like the

stress tensor itself, measured in units of pressure, and we shall soon see that the Lam´ coefﬁcients are

directly related to Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio.

For µ = 0 there are no shear stresses and all pressures become equal px = p y = pz = p, just as in a ﬂuid.
The arguments leading to the general form of Hooke’s law depend strongly on our understanding
of tensors as geometric objects in their own right with well-deﬁned transformation properties under
rotations. As soon as we have cast a law of nature in the form of a scalar, vector or tensor relation,
its validity in all Cartesian coordinate systems is immediately guaranteed. The form invariance of
the natural laws under transformations that relate different observers has since Einstein been an
important guiding principle in the development of modern theoretical physics.

Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio
Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio must be functions of the two Lam´ coefﬁcients. To derive the relations
e
between these material parameters we insert the stresses (11.6) and strains (11.7) for the simple stretching
of a material spring into the general relations (11.9a,b), and get,

The bulk modulus equals Young’s modulus for ν = 1/3, which is in fact a typical value for ν in many
materials. The Lam´ coefﬁcients and the bulk modulus are all proportional to Young’s modulus and thus of

the same order of magnitude. The values of the elastic moduli in metals are huge on ordinary scales, of the
order of 1011 Pa = 100 GPa = 106 bar.

Evidently, if the only stress is σx x = P , we obtain immediately from (11.18) the correct relations for simple
stretching, (11.6) and (11.7).

Positivity constraints
The bulk modulus K = λ + 2µ/3 cannot be negative, because a material with negative K would expand
when put under pressure. Imagine what would happen to such a strange material if placed in a closed vessel
also containing normal material like air or water. The hydrostatic pressure would make the strange material
expand, causing a further pressure increase followed by expansion until the whole thing blew up. Likewise,
materials with negative shear modulus, µ, would mimosa-like pull away from a shearing force instead of
yielding to it. Formally, it may be shown (see section 11.4) that the conditions 3λ + 2µ > 0 and µ > 0
follow from the elastic energy density being bounded from below. Although λ, in principle, may assume
negative values, natural materials always have λ ≥ 0.
Young’s modulus cannot be negative because of these constraints, and this conﬁrms that strings always
stretch when pulled at the ends. If there were materials with the ability to contract when pulled, they would
also behave magically. As you begin climbing up a rope made from such material, it pulls you further up.
Presumably, if such materials were ever created, they would spontaneously contract into nothingness at the
ﬁrst possible occasion or at least into a state with a normal relationship between stress and strain.
Poisson’s ratio ν = λ/2(λ + µ) depends only on the ratio λ/µ and reaches its maximum ν → 1/2
for λ/µ → ∞. In the extreme limit ν = 1/2 corresponding to µ = 0 there are no shear stresses in the
material which therefore behaves like a ﬂuid at rest. Since the bulk modulus K = 2µ + 3λ is positive
we have λ/µ > −2/3, and the minimal value of Poisson’s ratio ν = −1 is obtained for λ/µ = −2/3.
Although most materials shrink in the transverse directions when stretched, and thus have ν > 0, there
might actually exist materials which expand transversally without violating the laws of physics. In practice
all natural materials have ν > 0, but it is fairly easy to construct artiﬁcial models of materials that expand
when pulled, for example a grid of connected umbrellas.

Hooke’s law in isotropic materials, expressed by the linear relationships, (11.8) or (11.17), between stress
and strain, is only valid for stresses up to a certain value, called the proportionality limit. Beyond the
proportionality limit, nonlinearities set in, and the present formalism becomes invalid. Eventually, one
reaches a point, called the elasticity limit, where the material ceases to be elastic and undergoes permanent
deformation, or even fracture, without much further increase of stress. Hooke’s law is, however, a very
good approximation for most metals under normal conditions where stresses are tiny compared to the elastic
moduli.

For generally anisotropic materials, the linear relation between the stress and strain tensors, the
generalized Hooke’s law, is of the form,
σi j =

λi j kl u kl ,

(11.20)

kl

where the coefﬁcients λi j kl form a tensor of rank 4, called the elasticity tensor. For isotropic materials the
elasticity tensor is of the form,
λi j kl = λδi j δkl + µ(δik δ j l + δ j k δil ).

(11.21)

In general there are more parameters depending on the intrinsic complexity of the material structure.
Requiring only that the stress tensor is symmetric, the elasticity tensor connects the six independent
components of stress with the six independent components of strain and can in principle contain (6×6) = 36
independent parameters. If one further demands that an elastic energy function should exist (see problem
11.9) this (6 × 6) array of coefﬁcients must itself be symmetric under the exchange i j ↔ kl, i.e.
λi j kl = λkli j , and can thus only contain 6 + (6 × 5)/2 = 21 independent parameters. The orientation of an
anisotropic material relative to the coordinate system takes three parameters (Euler angles), so altogether
there may be up to 18 independent constants characterizing the intrinsic elastic properties of a general
anisotropic material, a number actually realized by triclinic crystals [37, 26].

11.3 Static uniform deformation
To see how Hooke’s law works for continuous systems, we now turn to the extremely simple case of a static
uniform deformation in which the strain tensor u i j takes the same value everywhere in a body at all times.
Hooke’s law (11.8) then ensures that the stress tensor is likewise constant throughout the body, so that all
its derivatives vanish, ∇k σi j = 0. From the condition for mechanical equilibrium, fi + j ∇ j σi j = 0,
it follows that f i = 0 so that uniform deformation necessarily excludes body forces. Conversely, in the
presence of body forces, there must always be non-uniform deformation of an isotropic material, a quite
reasonable conclusion.
Furthermore, at the boundary of a uniformly deformed body, the stress vector σ · n is as always required
to be continuous, and this puts strong restrictions on the form of the external forces that may act on the
surface of the body. Uniform deformation is for this reason only possible under very special circumstances,
but when it applies the analytic solution for the displacement ﬁeld is nearly trivial.

Uniform compression
In a ﬂuid at rest with a constant pressure P, the stress tensor is σi j = −Pδi j everywhere in the ﬂuid. If
a solid body made from isotropic material is immersed into this ﬂuid, the natural guess is that the pressure
will also be P inside the body. Inserting σi j = −Pδi j into (11.17) and using that k σkk = −3P, the
strain may be written,
ui j = −

The most general solution is obtained by adding an arbitrary small rigid body displacement to this solution.
We arrived at this result by making an educated guess of the form of the stress tensor inside the body.
It could in principle be wrong, but is in fact correct due to a uniqueness theorem to be derived in section
11.4. The theorem guarantees, in analogy with the uniqueness theorems of electrostatics, that provided the
equations of mechanical equilibrium and the boundary conditions are fulﬁlled by the guess (which they are
here), there is essentially only one solution to any elastostatic problem. The only liberty left is an arbitrary
rigid body displacement which may always be added to the solution.

A body made from isotropic,
homogenous material subject to a
uniform external pressure will be
uniformly compressed.

Uniform stretching
At the beginning of this chapter we investigated the reaction of a string-like material body stretched along
its main axis, say the x-direction, by means of a tension σx x = P acting uniformly over its cross section.
If there are no other external forces acting on the body, the natural guess is that the only non-vanishing
component of the stress tensor is σx x = P throughout the body. Inserting that into (11.16), we obtain as
before the strains (11.7).
The corresponding displacement ﬁeld is again found by integrating ∇x u x = u x x etc, and we ﬁnd the
particular solution

The solution describes as expected a simple dilatation along the x-axis and a contraction along the other
axes.

Uniform shear
Finally we return to the example from section 9.2 of a clamped slab of homogeneous, isotropic material in
the xz-plane, subjected to a shear force in the x-direction. As we argued, the shear stress σx y = P must
be constant throughout the material. Assuming that there are no other stresses, the only strain component
becomes u x y = P/2µ, and using that 2u x y = ∇x u y + ∇ y u x , we ﬁnd a particular solution
ux =

u y = u z = 0.

(11.26)

As expected, the displacement in the x-direction vanishes for y = 0 and grows linearly with y. Evidently,
this is why µ is called the shear modulus. In problem 11.8 the displacement ﬁeld is calculated without
making the assumption of small strains.

∗ 11.4 Energy of deformation
The work performed by the external force in extending a spring further by the amount δx is d W = δx =
kxδx. Integrating this expression, we obtain the total work W = (1/2)kx 2 , which is identiﬁed with the
well-known expression for the elastic energy, E = (1/2)kx 2 , stored in a stretched spring. Calculated per
unit of volume V = AL for a material string, we ﬁnd the density of elastic energy in the material

11. LINEAR ELASTICITY

Elastic energy
In the general case, strains and stresses vary over the body, and the calculation becomes more complicated.
To determine the general expression for the elastic energy density we use the expression derived in section
10.4,
δWdeform =

V ij

σi j δu i j d V.

(11.28)

This is the work that must be performed in order to change the internal strain ﬁeld by an inﬁnitesimal
amount δu i j .
If the stress tensor is a linear function of the strain tensor one must build up the deformation in
inﬁnitesimal steps, as we did for the gravitational self-energy in section 6.4. The elastic self-energy, i.e.
the energy of a deformation in its own stress ﬁeld, becomes in this way quadratic in the strain tensor with a
factor 1/2 to represent the average value of the ﬁnal stress ﬁeld,
=

(11.29)

where the integral runs over the volume V of the undeformed material. The corrections due to the change
of volume are negligible for small and smooth displacements.
In the general linear case the elastic energy density becomes,

For anisotropic materials the mere existence of such an energy function will, as mentioned, impose the
further condition that λi j kl must be symmetric under exchange i j ↔ kl (see problem 11.9).
For isotropic materials σi j is given by Hooke’s law (11.8) and the energy density simpliﬁes to,

Inserting the stresses for uniform stretching where the only non-vanishing stress is σx x = P, all the
dependence on Poisson’s ratio ν cancels out, bringing us back to the energy density in a material string
(11.27).
The energy density must be bounded from below, for if it were not, elastic materials would be unstable,
and an unlimited amount of work could be obtained by increasing the state of deformation. Imagine
for a moment how magically a body made from such material would behave when squeezed. From the
boundedness, it follows immediately that the shear modulus must be positive, µ > 0, because otherwise we
might make one of the off-diagonal components of the strain tensor, say u x y , grow without limit without
performing any work. The condition on λ is more subtle because the diagonal components of the strain
tensor are involved in both terms. For a uniform deformation with u i j = kδi j we get the energy density
= (3/2)(3λ+2µ)k 2 , implying that 3λ+2µ > 0, i.e. that the bulk modulus (11.15) is positive. In problem
11.7 it is shown that there are no stronger conditions.

Total energy in an external gravitational ﬁeld
In an external gravitational potential, (x), not depending on the displacement ﬁeld, the change in
gravitational energy due to the displacement of a material particle of ﬁxed mass d M from x = x + u(x)
to x is to leading order in the displacement,
(x ) −

(x) d M ≈ −g(x) · u(x) d M.

The last expression is obtained under the assumption that the displacement is small compared to the length
scale for variations in the gravitational potential. The total (potential) energy of a deformed body in a

where ρ(x) is the mass density of the body. This expression for the total potential energy of an elastic
body in a gravitational ﬁeld will be useful when we develop the theory behind numerical computation of
the displacement ﬁeld in mechanical equilibrium in chapter 13.
Suppose we vary the displacement ﬁeld by an inﬁnitesimal amount, δu i (x). The associated change in

In the second step we used the assumed symmetry of the coefﬁcients in the generalized Hooke’s law (11.20).
This is exactly the same as the work in a virtual displacement work (10.34), such that we have now explicitly
proven that the virtual work contributes to the internal energy, δ = δW .

Absolute minimum of energy in mechanical equilibrium
In mechanical equilibrium, f ∗ = 0, it follows from (10.33) that the virtual work is given entirely by the
external work of the contact forces on the surface of the body,
δ = δW =

S

δu · σ · d S.

(11.33)

If the external work also vanishes the total deformation energy will be unchanged or stationary, δ = 0,
under the variation in the displacement. In practice it often happens that some parts of the external boundary
of a body are held ﬁxed with vanishing displacement, u = 0, while other parts are left free with vanishing
stress vector, σ · n = 0. In that case the integrand of (11.33) will vanish everywhere on the surface of the
body, and the energy will be stationary under any variations respecting these boundary conditions.
Assuming that the elastic energy density (11.30) is a positive deﬁnite quadratic polynomial in the
strains, it follows that when no external work is performed on a body, the total potential energy must
have a unique minimum corresponding to mechanical equilibrium. Below we shall prove that this result
also guarantees the uniqueness of solutions in elastostatics, and we shall see in chapter 13 that it constitutes
the foundation for numerical calculations.

Proof of uniqueness of elastostatics solutions: To prove the uniqueness of the solutions to the
mechanical equilibrium equations (9.19) for linearly elastic materials we assume that we have two solutions
u(1) and u(2) that both satisfy the equilibrium equations and the boundary conditions for a speciﬁc problem.
Due to the linearity, the difference between the solutions u = u(1) − u(2) generates a difference in strain
u i j = (1/2)(∇i u j + ∇ j u i ) and a difference in stress σi j = kl λi j kl u kl . Under the assumption that the
body forces are identical for the two ﬁelds the change in stress satisﬁes the equation, j ∇ j σi j = 0, and
by means of Gauss’ theorem (4.22) we obtain as before,
0=

Here the surface integral vanishes because of the boundary conditions, which either specify the same

Using the symmetry of the stress tensor we get,

11. LINEAR ELASTICITY
The integrand is of the same form as the energy density (11.30), which is always assumed to be positive
deﬁnite, and consequently, the integral can only vanish if the strain tensor for the difference ﬁeld vanishes
everywhere in the body, i.e. u i j = 0.
Given the boundary conditions, there is essentially only one solution to the equations of mechanical
equilibrium in linear elastic materials. Although the two displacement ﬁelds may, in principle, differ by
a rigid body displacement, they must give rise to identical deformations everywhere in the body. If we
have somehow guessed a solution satisfying the equations of mechanical equilibrium and the boundary
conditions, it will necessarily be the right one.

Flagpoles, bridges, houses and towers are built from elastic materials, and are designed to stay in one place
with at most small excursions away from equilibrium due to wind and water currents. Ships, airplanes and
space shuttles are designed to move around, and their structural integrity depends crucially on the elastic
properties of the materials from which they are made. Almost all human constructions and natural structures
depend on elasticity for stability and ability to withstand external stresses [74, 76].
It can come as no surprise that the theory of static elastic deformation, elastostatics, is a huge
engineering subject. Engineers must know the deformation and internal stresses in their constructions
in order to predict risk of failure and set safety limits, and that is only possible if the elastic properties of
the building materials are known, and if they are able to solve the equations of elastostatics, or at least
get decent approximations to them. Today computers aid engineers in getting precise numeric solutions to
these equations and allow them to build critical structures, such as submarines, supertankers, airplanes and
space vehicles, in which over-dimensioning of safety limits is deleterious to fuel consumption as well as to
construction costs. In chapter 13 the basic technique behind the numeric solution of elastostatics problems
is presented and applied to the relatively simple two-dimensional problem of how a long block of elastic
material settles under gravity.
In this chapter we shall develop the theory of elastostatics for bodies made from isotropic materials and
apply it to generic cases with simple body geometries for which analytic solutions can be obtained. The
ﬁeld equations of elastostatics and their solutions are in many respects similar to the ﬁeld equations and
solutions of electrostatics and magnetostatics. They also bear comparison to the equations of stationary
ﬂuid ﬂow that will be taken up in later chapters.

Rewriting this in vector notation, we ﬁnally arrive at Navier’s equation of equilibrium, also called the
Navier–Cauchy equilibrium equation,
f + µ∇ 2 u + (λ + µ)∇ ∇ · u = 0.

(12.2)

After all the troubles with tensor notation, we end up with a relatively simple linear ﬁeld equation for the
vector displacement ﬁeld! One should, however, not be taken in by its apparent simplicity. There is a
surprising richness hidden in its compact form.
It should be noted that the linearity of the equilibrium equation permits us to superpose solutions to it.
For example, if you both compress and stretch a body uniformly, the displacement ﬁeld for the combined
operation will be the sum of the respective displacement ﬁelds, (11.25) and (11.24).
There is a subtlety in the derivation of the Navier–Cauchy equation which we have quietly ignored.
The problem arises from the use of the Lagrange representation where the displacement ﬁeld is
viewed as a function of the original coordinates x whereas the derivatives in the equation of
mechanical equilibrium (12.1c) refer to the actual coordinates x . Using the deﬁnition of the
displacement ﬁeld (10.2) we ﬁnd the following relation between the two kinds of derivatives,
∇i =

(12.3)

Under the assumption of small displacement derivatives (10.15) the second term may be consistently
ignored in the linear approximation, such that ∇i ≈ ∇i .

Estimates
Confronted with partial differential equations, it is always useful to get a rough idea of the order of
magnitude of a particular solution. It should be emphasized that such estimates just aim to ﬁnd the right
orders of magnitude of the ﬁelds, and that there may be special circumstances in a particular problem which
invalidate them. If that is the case, or if precision is needed, there is no way around analytic or numeric
calculation.
Imagine, for example, that a body made from elastic material is subjected to surface stresses of a typical
magnitude P and no body forces. A rough guess on order of magnitude of the stresses in the body is then
also σi j ∼ P. The elastic moduli λ, µ, E and K are all of the same magnitude, so that the deformation
is of the order of u i j ∼ P/E. Since the deformation is calculated from gradients of the displacement
ﬁeld, the variation in displacement across a body of typical size L may be estimated to be of the order of
u i ∼ Lu i j ∼ L P/E.
Example 12.1.1 (Deformation of a chair): Standing with your full weight of 70 kg on the seat of a
chair supported by four wooden legs, each 7 cm2 in cross section and 50 cm long, you exert a stress
P ≈ 250 kPa = 2.5 bar on the legs. Taking E ≈ 109 Pa, the deformation will be about 2.5 × 10−4 and
the maximal displacement about 0.12 mm. The squashing of the legs of the chair due to your weight is
barely visible.
In mechanical equilibrium (12.1c), there is balance between local changes in stress and body forces. This
allows us to estimate the change in stress over a distance L due to, for example gravity f = ρ g to be
σi j ≈ ρgL. The corresponding variation in strain becomes u i j ∼ Lρg/E for non-exceptional materials.
Since u i j is dimensionless, it is convenient to deﬁne a deformation scale,

so that u i j ∼ L/D. The quantity D has dimension of length and sets the scale for major changes in
deformation (of order unity). Small deformations require L
D. Finally, we estimate the variation in the
displacement over a distance L to be of magnitude u i ∼ Lu i j ∼ L 2 /D, which depends quadratically on L.
Example 12.1.2 (Settling of a tall building): How much does a tall building settle under its own
weight when it is built? Let the height of the building be L = 413 m, its ground area A = 63 × 63 m2 ,
and the average mass density ρ = 100 kg m−3 , including walls, columns, ﬂoors, ofﬁce equipment and
people. The weight of it all is carried by steel columns taking up about f = 1% of its ground area.
The total mass of the building is M = ρ AL = 1.6 × 108 kg and the stress in the supports at ground
level is P = Mg0 / f A ≈ 400 bar. Taking Young’s modulus to be that of steel, E = 2 × 1011 Pa, the
deformation scale becomes huge, D ∼ f E/ρg0 ≈ 2000 km so that the strain is about 2 × 10−4 . The
top of the building settles thus by merely L 2 /D ≈ 8 cm.

Solid objects, be they mountains, bridges, houses or coffee cups, standing on a surface are deformed by
gravity, and deform in turn, by their weight, the supporting surface. Intuition tells us that gravity makes
such objects settle towards the ground and squashes their material so that it bulges out horizontally, unless
prevented by constraining walls. In a ﬂuid at rest, each horizontal surface element has to carry the weight
of the column of ﬂuid above it, and this determines the pressure in the ﬂuid. In a solid at rest, this is more
or less also the case, except that shear elastic stresses in the material are able to distribute the vertical load
in the horizontal directions.

Settling of a body under the
inﬂuence of gravity.

Uniform settling
An inﬁnitely extended slab of homogeneous and isotropic elastic material placed on a horizontal surface is
a kind of ‘elastic sea’, which like the ﬂuid sea may be assumed to have the same properties everywhere in
a horizontal plane. In a ﬂat-Earth coordinate system, where gravity is given by g = (0, 0, −g0 ), we expect
a uniformly vertical displacement, which only depends on the z-coordinate,
u = (0, 0, u z (z)) = u z (z) ez .

(12.5)

In order to realize this ‘elastic sea’ in a ﬁnite system, it must be surrounded by ﬁxed, vertical and slippery
walls. The vertical walls forbid horizontal but allow vertical displacement, and at the bottom, z = 0, we
place a horizontal supporting surface which forbids vertical but allows horizontal displacement. At the top,
z = h, the elastic material is left free to move without any external forces acting on it.

the ﬂuid sea. It balances everywhere the full weight of the material above, but this was expected since there
are no shear stresses to distribute the vertical load. The horizontal pressures px = p y = pz λ/(λ + 2µ)
are also positive but smaller than the vertical, because both λ and µ are positive in normal materials. The
horizontal pressures are eventually balanced by the ﬁxed vertical walls.

The displacement is always negative, largest in magnitude at the top, z = h, and varies quadratically with
height h at the top, as expected from the estimate in the preceding section.

Shear-free settling
What happens if we remove the container walls? A ﬂuid will of course spill out all over the place, whereas
an elastic material is only expected to settle a bit more while bulging horizontally out where the walls were
before. Jelly on a ﬂat plate is perhaps the best image to have in mind. In spite of the basic simplicity of
the problem, there seems to be no simple analytic solution. But if one cannot ﬁnd the right solution to a
problem, it is common practice in physics to redeﬁne the problem to ﬁt a solution which one can get! What
we can obtain is a solution with no shear stresses (in the chosen coordinates), but the price we pay is that
the vertical displacement will not vanish across the bottom of the container, as it ought to.
The equilibrium equations (12.1c) with all shear stresses set to zero, i.e. σx y = σ yz = σzx = 0,
simplify now to
∇x σx x = 0,

∇ y σ yy = 0,

∇z σzz = ρ0 g0 .

(12.12)

The ﬁrst equation says that σx x does not depend on x, or in other words that σx x is constant on straight
lines parallel with the x-axis. But such lines must always cross the vertical sides, where the x-component
of the stress vector, σx x n x , has to vanish, and consequently we must have σx x = 0 everywhere. In the same
way it follows that σ yy = 0 everywhere. Finally, the third equation tells us that σzz is linear in z, and using
the condition that σzz = 0 for z = h we ﬁnd
σzz = −ρ0 g0 (h − z),

(12.13)

implying that every column carries the weight of the material above it. This result was again to be expected
because there are no shear stresses to redistribute the vertical load.
From the inverse Hooke’s law (11.16), the non-vanishing strain components are found to be

12.3. BENDING A BEAM
The trouble with this solution is that we cannot impose ﬂatness at the bottom, i.e. u z = 0 for z = 0,
as we would like to do. The vertical displacement is negative everywhere at the bottom except at the circle
x 2 + y 2 = a 2 , where it vanishes. In the x y-plane, however, the horizontal displacement represents a
uniform expansion in all horizontal directions with a z -dependent scale factor, which vanishes on top and
is maximal at the bottom. Instead of describing the deformation of a block of material sitting on a hard and
ﬂat horizontal surface, we have obtained a solution which seems to describe a cylindrical block sinking into
the supporting surface!
There can be only one explanation, namely that the initial assumption about the shear-free stress tensor
is wrong. What seems to be needed to ﬁnd a solution including a hard, ﬂat supporting surface is an extra
vertical pressure distribution from the supporting surface which is able to ‘shore up’ the sagging underside
of the shear-free solution and make it ﬂat. We expect that this extra pressure will be accompanied by shear
stresses, enabling the inner part of the block close to x = 0 to carry more than its share of the weight of the
material above it, and the outer part at x = a to carry less. This intuition is in fact veriﬁed by numerical
solution (see section 13.3).
The extra stress distribution can presumably only exert inﬂuence on the deformation up to a height of
the same order of magnitude as the horizontal dimensions of the block. For a tall block, the shear-free
solution may thus be expected to be practically valid everywhere except in a region near the bottom of the
same height as the horizontal dimensions of the block. This argument is an application of a rule known as
Saint-Venant’s principle, which states that the effects of a particular application of external forces is only
notable near the regions where these forces are applied.

Bending a beam by wrenching it
at the ends.

Sticks, rods, girders, struts, masts, towers, planks, poles and pipes are all examples of a generic object,
which we shall call a beam. Geometrically, a beam consists of a bundle of straight parallel lines or rays,
covering the same cross section in any plane orthogonal to the lines. Physically, the beam is assumed to be
made from homogeneous and isotropic elastic material.

¹
¹
¹

Uniform pure bending
There are many ways to bend a beam. A cantilever is a beam that is ﬁxed at one end and bends like a
horizontal ﬂagpole or a ﬁshing rod. A beam may also be weighed down in the middle like a bridge, but the
cleanest way to bend it is probably to grab it close to the ends and wrench it like a pencil so that it adopts
a uniformly curved shape. Ideally, in pure bending, external stresses should not be applied to the sides
of the beam, but only to the terminal cross sections, and on average these stresses should neither stretch
nor compress the beam, but only provide external couples (moments) at the terminals. It should be noted
that such couples do not require shear stresses, but may be created by normal stresses alone which vary in
strength over the terminal cross sections. If you try, you will realize that it is in fact rather hard to bend a
pencil in this way. Bending a rubber eraser by pressing it between two ﬁngers is somewhat easier, but tends
to add longitudinal compression as well.
The bending of the beam is also assumed to be uniform, such that the physical conditions, stresses and
strains, will be the same everywhere along the beam. This is only possible if the originally straight beam
of length L is deformed to become a section of a (huge) circular ring of radius R with every ray becoming
part of a perfect circle. In that case, it is sufﬁcient to consider just a tiny slice of the beam in order to
understand uniform bending for a beam of any length. We shall see below that non-uniform bending can
also be handled by piecing together little slices with varying radius of curvature. Furthermore, by appealing
to Saint-Venant’s principle and linearity, we may even calculate the properties of a beam subject to different
types of terminal loads by judicious superposition of displacement ﬁelds.

Centring the beam
In a Cartesian coordinate system, we align the undeformed beam with the z-axis, and put the terminal cross
sections at z = 0 and z = L. The length L of the beam may be chosen as small as we please. The cross
section A in the x y-plane may be of arbitrary shape, but we may, without loss of generality, position the

We require in other words that the z-axis, x = y = 0, coincides with the central ray of the unbent beam.
Finally, we ﬁx the remaining degree of freedom by requiring the central ray after bending to be part of a
circle in the xz-plane with radius R and its centre on the x-axis at x = R. The radius R is obviously the
length scale for major deformation.

Shear-free solution
What precisely happens in the beam when it is bent depends on the way the actual stresses are distributed
on its terminals, although by Saint-Venant’s principle, the details should only matter near the terminals. In
the simplest case we may view the beam as a loose bundle of thin elastic strings that do not interact with
each other, but are stretched or compressed individually according to their position in the beam without
generating shear stresses. Let us ﬁx the central string so that it does not change its length L, when bent into
a circle. A simple geometric construction then shows that a nearby ray in position x will change its length
to L = L(1 − x/R), and consequently experience a longitudinal strain,
u zz =

L −L
x
=− .
L
R

(12.18)

For negative x the material of the beam is being stretched, while for positive x it is being compressed.
Under the assumption that the bending is done without shear and that there are no forces acting on the
sides of the beam, it follows as in the preceding section that σx x = σ yy = 0. The only non-vanishing stress
is σzz = Eu zz , and the non-vanishing strains are as before found from the inverted Hooke’s law (11.16),
u x x = u yy = −νu zz = ν

(12.19)

where ν is Poisson’s ratio. This shows that the material is being stretched horizontally for x < 0 and
compressed for x > 0.

The quadratic terms dependent on y and z in u x are as in the preceding section forced upon us by
the requirement of no shear stresses (and strains). In order for displacement gradients to be small, all
dimensions of the beam have to be small compared to R. Note that the beam’s actual dimensions do not
appear in the displacement ﬁeld, so that this may be considered to be an entirely local solution to the bending
problem.

It is a tension for negative x, and we consequently expect the material of the beam to ﬁrst break down at the
extreme point of the cross section opposite to the direction of bending, as common experience also tells us.

because of the conditions (12.17). The total force would of course vanish even if the beam was not centred,
because the stress would then be σzz = −E(x − x0 )/R where x0 is the x-coordinate of the centre.
If the terminal load is not a pure moment, the total force on a cross section will not vanish, but the
linearity of the Navier–Cauchy equilibrium equation (12.2) allows us as usual to superpose solutions. A
uniform normal force z may, for example, be included by adding the stretching displacement ﬁeld (11.25)

where P = z /A. Similarly, uniform shear forces x and y may be included by adding the shear

Å y = − xσzz d Sz = E x 2 d xd y.

(12.24)
(12.25)

It is often the case that the undeformed beam is mirror symmetric under reﬂection in the xz-plane or in the
yz-plane, so that A x y d xd y = 0, and this implies that Åx = 0. The important moment is the one in the
bending plane, i.e. Å y .
The expression for Å y is the same as the Bernoulli–Euler law,

is the ‘moment of inertia’ of the beam cross section around the direction of Å (analogous to the area
moment of the ship’s waterline in equation (5.26) on page 67). Note that constant shear or normal stresses, if
present, do not contribute to the cross-section moment, and in many engineering applications the Bernoulli–
Euler law combined with linearity and Saint-Venant’s principle is enough to give a reasonable idea of how
much a beam is deformed by external loads.

It grows more rapidly with the width of the beam in the direction of bending (x) than orthogonally to it (y).
This agrees with the common experience that to obtain a given bending radius R it is much harder to bend
a thick beam than a thin. In lorries and train wagons ﬂat steel springs are often used to soften the impact
forces due to irregularities in the road or rails.

Threshold for buckling
A walking stick must be chosen with care. Too sturdy, and it will be heavy and unyielding; too slender, and it
may buckle or even collapse under the weight you put on it. More generally, all kinds of columns and struts
are used to support buildings and other structures, and buckling can lead to dangerous collapse. Luckily,
however, buckling does not happen until the forces on the beam terminals exceed a certain threshold, ﬁrst
determined by Euler.
Let an undeformed slender beam of length L be placed ‘vertically’ along the z-axis. Applying a constant
terminal force along the negative z-direction, it follows from geometry that the moment exerted by the
upper part of the deformed beam on a cross section is Å = x , where x is the ‘horizontal’ displacement
of the cross section at ‘height’ z. There will also be non-vanishing normal and shear forces at play in the
cross section, but as discussed above they do not contribute to the moment. Evidently, the moment is not
constant throughout the deformed beam, so this cannot be a uniform pure bending of the beam. We may
nevertheless exploit the Bernouilli–Euler law (12.26) and relate the local moment to the local curvature,

A strut with a longitudinal terminal load may buckle when the
force exceeds a certain threshold.
There is of course an
equal and opposite force from the
‘ground’ at z = 0. The local moment exerted in a strut cross section is Å = x .

1

x.
(12.30)
R
EI
This result is valid for any deformation of the terminally loaded beam and shows that the curvature is largest
in the middle of the beam and smallest at the ends where x vanishes.
To determine the threshold for buckling, we assume that the beam is only slightly displaced, such that
the curvature is given by the double derivative, 1/R ≈ −d 2 x/dz 2 . The above expression then becomes an
equation for the shape,

√

d2x
= −k 2 x,
dz 2

(12.31)

where k =
/E I . This is nothing but the standard harmonic equation with ‘wavenumber’ k, and its
general solution is x = A sin kz + B cos kz where A and B are constants. Applying the boundary conditions
that x = 0 for z = 0 and z = L, the solution becomes,
nπ z
,
(12.32)
x = A sin
L
where n is an arbitrary integer. This shows that k = nπ/L and since = k 2 E I we arrive at Euler’s result
for the force,
EI
= n2π 2 2 .
(12.33)
L
This is quite surprising: the slightly displaced shape of a terminally loaded beam is only mechanically stable
for certain values of the applied force, corresponding to integer values of n.
Actually, this conclusion cannot be right because everyday experience tells us that we can load a
walking stick with a small terminal force and still keep it in stable equilibrium. This is in fact what we
do when we lean on it. What must happen is that a small force cannot bend the beam but only compress
it longitudinally, an effect we have not taken into account in the above calculation. As the applied force
increases, it will eventually reach the threshold value corresponding to n = 1 above,
2
E =π

EI
,
L2

(12.34)

and at this point the longitudinal compression mode becomes unstable and the ﬁrst buckling solution takes
over at the slightest provocation. To prove that this is indeed what takes place requires a stability analysis,
which we shall not go into here. In practice only the lowest mode is seen, unless a strong force is rapidly
applied, in which case the beam may crumble and collapse completely. That is why you wouldn’t choose a
straw as your walking stick!
Example 12.3.1 (Wooden stick): A wooden walking stick has length L = 1 m and circular cross
section of radius a = 1 cm. Taking Young’s modulus E = 1010 Pa and using (12.29), the buckling
threshold becomes E = 775 N, corresponding to the weight of 79 kg. If you weigh more, it would be
prudent to choose a slightly thicker stick. Since the threshold grows as the fourth power of the radius,
increasing the radius by just one millimetre raises the threshold mass to 116 kg which is sufﬁcient for
most people.

∗ Shape of a relaxed stringed bow
If the applied force continues to increase beyond the threshold value, the displacement grows rapidly and
the approximation used in Euler’s calculation ceases to be valid. A relaxed stringed bow may, for example,
be viewed as a beam that has been brought beyond the buckling threshold and is kept in equilibrium by the
tension in the bowstring. In this case, the overall displacement of the beam is not small, even if the local
strains are small everywhere.

Together these expressions deﬁne the shape of the beam parametrized by θ. In the margin three different
bow shapes are plotted.
Example 12.3.2 (Steel bow): A longbow is constructed from a rectangular steel beam of length
L = 200 cm with dimensions 2a = 10 mm and 2b = 20 mm. The bow is stringed with an opening
angle of 30 ◦ corresponding to α = 60 ◦ . The maximal string distance from the bow becomes d ≈ 32 cm
and the stringed height h ≈ 186 cm. The moment of inertia becomes I ≈ 1.67 × 10−9 m4 , and taking
E = 2 × 1011 Pa the Euler threshold becomes E ≈ 822 N. Since /FE ≈ 1.035 we ﬁnd = 851 N,
corresponding to a weight of 87 kg. It would take ‘Little John’s’ strength to ﬁt the string to this bow
and shoot an arrow. If the thickness were reduced by 20%, it would only take half the strength to string
it.

12.4 Twisting a shaft
The drive shaft in older cars connects the gear box to the differential and transmits engine power to the
rear wheels. In characterizing engine performance, maximum torque is often quoted, because it creates
the largest shear force between wheels and road and therefore maximal acceleration, barring wheel-spin.
Although the shaft is made from steel, it will nevertheless undergo a tiny deformation, a torsion or twist.

The displacement ﬁeld for a
rotation through a tiny angle
τ z (exaggerated here) is purely
tangential and grows linearly
with the radial distance.

Pure torsion
The shaft is assumed to be a circular beam with radius a and axis coinciding with the z-axis. The
deformation is said to be a pure torsion if the shaft’s material is rotated by a constant amount τ per unit
of length, such that a given cross section at the position z is rotated by an angle τ z relative to the cross
section at z = 0. The constant τ which measures the rotation angle per unit of length is sometimes called
the torsion angle.
The uniform nature of pure torsion allows us to consider just a small slice of the shaft of length L
which is only twisted through a tiny angle, τ L
1. Since the physical conditions are the same in all such
slices, we can later put them together to make a shaft of any length. To lowest order in the angle τ z, the
displacement ﬁeld in the slice becomes
u = τ zez × x = τ z(−y, x, 0).

(12.40)

Not surprisingly, it is purely tangential and is always much smaller than the radius, a, of the shaft because

Strain and stress

For this matrix to be small, we must also require τ a
over a length of the shaft comparable to its radius.
The only non-vanishing strains are,

(12.41)

1, or in other words that the twist must be small

u x z = − 1 τ y,
2

u yz = 1 τ x.
2

(12.42)

The corresponding stresses are obtained from Hooke’s law (11.8),
σx z = σzx = −µτ y,

σ yz = σzy = µτ x.

(12.43)

Inserting these stresses into the equilibrium equations (12.1c), it is seen that it is trivially fulﬁlled.
At the cylindrical surface of the shaft, the normal is (x, y, 0)/a, and the stress vector vanishes, i.e.
σzx x/a + σzy y/a = 0, as it should when there are no external forces acting there.
This solution was ﬁrst obtained by Coulomb in 1787, whereas the corresponding solution for rods
with non-circular cross section (see [37, p. 59] or [65, p. 109]) was obtained by Saint-Venant in 1855.

In order to realize a pure torsion, the correct stress distribution (12.43) must be applied to the ends of
the shaft. Applying a different stress distribution by, for example, grabbing one end of the shaft with a
monkey-wrench, leads to a different solution near the end, but the pure torsion solution should according to
Saint-Venant’s principle still be valid far away from the ends.

Torque
In any cross section we may calculate the total moment of force around the shaft axis, in this context called
= x × d = x × σ · d S. Since the cross section

lies in the x y-plane, we have d S = ez d xd y, and the z-component of the moment becomes,

(12.44)

The quantity

(12.45)

is called the torsional rigidity of the shaft. The torsional rigidity depends only the radius of the shaft and
the shear modulus but not on the applied torque. Knowing the torsional rigidity and the torque Å, one may
calculate the torsion angle τ = Å/C, and conversely.

Transmitted power
If the shaft rotates with constant angular velocity , the material at the point (x, y, z) will have velocity
v(x, y) = ez × x = (−y, x, 0). The shear stresses acting on an element of the cross section,
d S = ez d xd y, will transmit a power (i.e. work per unit of time) of d P = v · d = v · σ · d S. Integrating
over the cross section the total power becomes,
P=

A

v · σ · dS =

As the derivation shows, this relation P =

A

·

(xσ yz − yσx z )d xd y =

Åz .

(12.46)

Å is generally valid.

Example 12.4.1 (Car engine): The typical torque delivered by a family car engine can be of the order
of 100 Nm. If the shaft rotates with 3000 rpm, corresponding to an angular velocity of ≈ 314 s−1 ,
the transmitted power is about 31.4 kW, or 42 horsepower. For a drive shaft made of steel with radius
a = 2 cm, the torsional rigidity is C ≈ 2 × 104 Nm2 . In direct drive without gearing, the torsion angle
becomes τ ≈ 0.005 m−1 = 0.3 ◦ m−1 . For a car with rear-wheel drive, the length of the drive shaft
may be about 2 m, and the total twist amounts to about 0.6 ◦ . The maximal shear stress in the material
is µτ a ≈ 8 × 106 Pa = 80 bar at the rim of the shaft.

12.5 Tube under pressure
Elastic tubes carrying ﬂuids under pressure are found everywhere, in living organisms and in machines,
not forgetting the short moments of intense pressure in the barrel of a gun or canon. How much does a
tube expand because of the pressure, and how is the deformation distributed? What are the stresses in the
material and where will it tend to break down?

Uniform radial displacement
The ideal tube is a beam in the shape of a circular cylinder with inner radius a, outer radius b and length L,
made from homogeneous and isotropic elastic material. When subjected to a uniform internal pressure, the
tube is expected to expand radially and perhaps also contract longitudinally. The latter may be prevented

It is tempting here to introduce true cylindrical coordinates, (r, φ, z), instead of the Cartesian coordinates,
(x, y, z), but although more systematic it would in fact make the following analysis harder. The only other
element we need here is the angular unit vector
eφ =

which is orthogonal to both er and ez = (0, 0, 1). The three unit vectors form together a local orthogonal

Since ∇r = er , it follows from the radial assumption (12.47) that the displacement ﬁeld may be written as
the gradient of another ﬁeld
u = ∇ψ(r ),

ψ(r ) =

u r (r ) dr.

(12.54)

Now the gradient of its divergence becomes,
∇i ∇ · u = ∇i ∇ 2 ψ = ∇ 2 ∇i ψ = ∇ 2 u i ,

and the Navier–Cauchy equation (12.2) takes the much simpler form
f + (2µ + λ)∇∇ · u = 0.

f + (2µ + λ)er

(12.57)

This shows that the body force density, if present, must also be radial,

and we ﬁnally arrive at the ordinary second-order differential equation in r ,
fr + (λ + 2µ)

Given a radial body force, this equation may be integrated to yield the radial displacement.

(12.60)

where A is a constant. Integrating once more we obtain
u r (r ) = Ar +

B

r

(12.61)

where B is another constant. These constants will be determined by the boundary conditions imposed on
the tube.

written
∇u =

consequence of the ﬁxed clamps on the ends of the cylinder.

The boundary conditions are σrr = −P at the inside surface r = a and σrr = 0 at the outside surface
r = b. The minus sign may be a bit surprising, but remember that the normal to the inside surface of

For normal materials with 0 < ν ≤ 1/2, the radial strain u rr is negative, corresponding to a compression
of the material, whereas the tangential strain u φφ is always positive, corresponding to an extension. There
is no longitudinal strain because of the clamping of the ends of the tube.
The scale of the strain is again set by the ratio P/E. For normal materials under normal pressures,
for example an iron pipe with E ≈ 1 Mbar subject to a water pressure of a few bars, the strain is only
of the order of parts per million, whereas the strains in the walls of your garden hose or the arteries
in your body are much larger. When the walls become thin, i.e. for d = b − a
a, the strains grow
stronger because of the denominator b2 − a 2 ≈ 2da, and actually diverge towards inﬁnity in the
limit. This is in complete agreement with agreement with our understanding that the walls of a tube
need to be of a certain thickness to withstand the internal pressure.

(12.71)

which is the product of two factors, both smaller than unity for a < r < b. The tangential pressure

for thin-walled tubes. The average pressure

is also negative and like the longitudinal pressure is constant throughout the material. Note that the average
pressure is not continuous with the pressure outside the tube. This conﬁrms the suspicion voiced on page
115 that the pressure may behave differently in a solid with shear stresses than the pressure in a ﬂuid at rest,
which has to be continuous across boundaries in the absence of surface tension.

Blowup: A tube under pressure develops cracks and eventually blows up if the material is extended
beyond a certain limit. Compression does not matter, except for enormous pressures. The point where the
tube breaks is primarily determined by the point of maximal local tension and extension. As we have seen,
this occurs at the inside of the tube for r = a in the tangential direction. A crack will develop where the
material has a small weakness, and the tube then blows up from the inside!

Unclamped tube
The constancy of the longitudinal tension (12.70c) permits us to solve the case of an unclamped tube by
superposing the above solution with the displacement ﬁeld for uniform stretching (11.25). In the cylindrical
basis the ﬁeld of uniform stretching becomes (after interchanging x and z)

Thin wall approximation
Most tubes have thin walls relative to their radius. Let us introduce the wall thickness, d = b − a, and the
radial distance, s = r − a, from the inner wall. In the thin-wall approximation, these quantities are small
compared to a, and we obtain the following expressions to leading order for the unclamped tube.

Historically, almost all of the insights into elasticity were obtained by means of analytic calculations,
carried out by some of the best scientists of the time using the most advanced methods available to them,
sometimes even inventing new mathematical concepts and methods along the way. Textbooks on the theory
of elasticity are often hard to read because of their demands on the reader for command of mathematics
[44, 27, 50, 17, 66].
In the last half of the twentieth century, the development of the digital computer has changed the
character of this ﬁeld completely. Faced with a problem in elastostatics, modern engineers quickly turn to
numerical computation. The demand for prompt solutions to design problems has over the years evolved
these numerical methods into a ﬁne art, and numerous commercial and public domain programs are now
available to assist engineers in understanding the elastic properties of their constructions.
In this chapter we shall illustrate how it is possible to solve a concrete problem numerically, providing
sufﬁcient detail that a computer program can be implemented. It is not the intention here to expose the
wealth of tricks of the trade, but just present the basic reasoning behind the numerical approach and the
various steps that must be carried out in order to make a successful numerical simulation. First, one must
decide on the ﬁeld equations and boundary conditions that should be implemented, and what simpliﬁcations
can be made to these from the outset. Second, the inﬁnity of points in continuous space must be replaced
by a ﬁnite set, often a regular grid or lattice, and the fundamental equations must be approximated on this
set. Third, a method must be adopted for an iterative approach towards the desired solution, and ﬁnally
one needs to choose convergence criteria that enable one to monitor the progress of the computation and
calculate error estimates that give conﬁdence in the solution.

13.1 Relaxing towards equilibrium
As we do not, from the outset, know the solution to the problem we wish to solve by numerical means, we
must begin by making an educated guess about the initial displacement ﬁeld. This guess should preferably
satisfy the boundary conditions, but unless we are incredibly lucky it will fail to satisfy the mechanical
equilibrium equation, resulting in a non-vanishing effective body force fi∗ = f i + j ∇ j σi j . The idea is
now to create an iterative procedure which through a sequence of tiny displacements δu will proceed from
an arbitrary initial state towards the desired equilibrium state, satisfying f ∗ = 0 with the right boundary
conditions.

13. COMPUTATIONAL ELASTOSTATICS

Work and relaxation
It was shown in section 11.4 that the (potential) energy of a displaced elastic body in an external
gravitational ﬁeld f = ρ g is the sum of gravitational and elastic contributions,
=−

(13.1)

It was also shown that the change in energy under an arbitrary variation in displacement is given by,
δ =−

V

δu · f ∗ d V +

S

δu · σ · d S.

(13.2)

Here the ﬁrst term represents the work done against the non-equilibrium effective body forces under the
change in displacement, and the second term represents the work of the external stresses acting on the
surface of the body. The second term evidently vanishes if every point of the surface of the body is either
held ﬁxed, δu = 0, or left free to vary with no stresses, σ · n = 0. We shall assume this to be the case in the
following, such that the change in energy under any variation respecting these boundary conditions is given
by the ﬁrst term, which vanishes in equilibrium.
The iterative procedure now consists of designing each inﬁnitesimal displacement to drain energy away
from the body, such that it continually moves towards states of lower energy while respecting the boundary
conditions. Since we perform negative work against the non-equilibrium forces, i.e. they perform work on
us, such a procedure is said to relax the body. When δ < 0 in each iteration the energy of the body will
decrease until it reaches a minimum, which in section 11.4 for linear elastic materials was shown to be
unique. Having arrived at the minimum, the internal energy must be stationary δ = 0 for all variations
in displacement δu(x), and that is only possible if f ∗ (x) = 0 for all x. Thus, in the end the relaxation
procedure will arrive at an equilibrium state.

Gradient descent
A common relaxation procedure is to select the change in displacement to always be proportional to the
effective force,
δu =

f ∗,

(13.3)

where is a positive quantity, called the step-size. Relaxing the displacement in this way by ‘running along’
with the effective force guarantees that the density of work, − f ∗ · δu = − ( f ∗ )2 , is negative everywhere
and thus drains energy away from every material particle in the body that is not already in equilibrium.
Since the displacement ‘walks downhill’ against the gradient of the total energy (in the space of all allowed
displacement ﬁelds), it is naturally called gradient descent.
Gradient descent is not a foolproof method, even when the energy (as in linear elastic media) is a
quadratic function of the displacement ﬁeld with a unique minimum. In particular the step-size
must be chosen judiciously. Too small, and the procedure may never seem to converge; too large,
it may overshoot the minimum and go into oscillations or even diverge. Many ﬁne tricks have been
invented to get around these problems and speed up convergence [59, 10], for example conjugate
gradient descent in which the optimal step-size is calculated in advance by searching for a minimum
along the chosen direction of descent. Here, however, we shall just use the straightforward technique
of the dedicated downhill skier, always looking for the steepest gradient.

13.2 Discretization of space
The inﬁnity of points in space cannot be represented in a ﬁnite computer. In numerical simulations of
the partial differential equations of continuum physics, smooth space is nearly always replaced by a ﬁnite
collection of points, a grid or lattice, on which the various ﬁelds ‘live’. In Cartesian coordinates the most
convenient grid for a rectangular volume a ×b×c is a rectangular lattice with (Nx +1)×(N y +1)×(Nz +1)

13.2. DISCRETIZATION OF SPACE

167

points that are equally spaced at coordinate intervals x = a/Nx , y = b/N y , and z = c/Nz . The grid
coordinates are numbered by n x = 0, 1, . . . , Nx , n y = 0, 1, . . . , N y and n z = 0, 1, . . . , Nz , and the
various ﬁelds can only exist at the positions (x, y, z) = (n x x, n y y, n z z).
There are many other ways of discretizing space besides using rectangular lattices, for example
triangular, hexagonal or even random lattices. The choice of grid depends on the problem itself, as
well as on the ﬁeld equations and the boundary conditions. The coordinates in which the system is
most conveniently described may not be Cartesian but curvilinear, and that leads to quite a different
discretization. The surface of the body may or may not ﬁt well with the chosen grid, but that problem
may be alleviated by making the grid very dense at the cost of computer time and memory. When
boundaries are irregular, as they usually are for real bodies, an adaptive grid that can ﬁt itself to the
shape of the body may be the best choice. Such a grid may also adapt to put more points where they
are needed in regions of rapid variation of the displacement ﬁeld.

Finite difference operators with ﬁrst-order errors
In a discrete space, coordinate derivatives of ﬁelds such as ∇x f (x, y, z) must be approximated by ﬁnite
differences between the ﬁeld values at the allowed points. Using only the nearest neighbours on the grid
there are two basic ways of forming such differences at a given internal point of the lattice, namely forwards
and backwards

Here and in the following we suppress for clarity the ‘sleeping’ coordinates y and z and furthermore assume
that ﬁnite differences in these coordinates are deﬁned analogously.

with errors of second order only. The central difference does not involve the ﬁeld value at the central point
x, so one should be wary of possible ‘leapfrog’ or ‘ﬂipﬂop’ numeric instabilities in which half the points of
the lattice behave differently than the other half.
On a boundary, the central difference cannot be calculated, and one is forced to use one-sided
differences. If the grid is rectangular with a rectangular border, one must use the right-hand difference
on the boundary to the left and the left-hand difference on the boundary to the right. In order to consistently

Other schemes involving more distant neighbours to suppress even higher order errors are of course
also possible.

Numeric integration
In simulations it will also be necessary to calculate various line, surface and volume integrals over
discretized space. Since the ﬁelds are only known at the points of the discrete lattice, the integrals must be
replaced by suitably weighted sums over the lattice points.
a
Let us, for example, consider a one-dimensional integral over an interval, say 0 f (x) d x, on a regular
grid with coordinates xn = n x where n = 0, 1, . . . , N . The contribution to the integral from the n th
subinterval xn ≤ x ≤ xn+1 is approximated by the trapezoidal rule [59, p. 131]

13.3 Gravitational settling in two dimensions

¹x

a
Expected two-dimensional gravitational settling. If the wall at
x = a is removed, the elastic material will bulge out, because of
its own weight.

One of the simplest non-trivial problems that does not seem to admit an exact analytic solution is the
gravitational settling of a rectangular block of elastic material in a long open box of dimensions a × b × c
with one of the sides removed (see section 12.2 for the case where all sides are removed).
In this case we follow the conventions normally used in two dimensions and take the y-axis to be
vertical. The wall that is removed is situated at x = a whereas the wall at x = 0 remains in place. It is
reasonable to assume that the clamping in the z-direction at z = 0 and z = c prevents any displacement in
that direction, i.e. u z = 0 everywhere. Since the block is assumed to be very long in this direction, it is also
reasonable to assume that the displacements u x and u y only depend on x and y, but not on z. The problem
has become effectively two-dimensional, although there are vestiges of the three-dimensional problem, for
example the non-vanishing stress along the z-direction which is taken up by the walls at the ends.

Equations
The components of the two-dimensional strain tensor are
u x x = ∇x u x ,
u yy = ∇ y u y ,

(13.8b)

u x y = 1 (∇x u y + ∇ y u x ).
2

(13.8c)

(13.8a)

The corresponding stresses are found from Hooke’s law (11.9) and (11.10),
σx x = (2µ + λ)u x x + λu yy ,

(13.9a)

σ yy = (2µ + λ)u yy + λu x x ,

(13.9b)

σx y = σ yx = 2µ u x y .

(13.9c)

Finally, the components of the effective force are
∗
f x = ∇x σx x + ∇ y σx y ,

(13.10a)

∗
f y = ∇x σx y + ∇ y σ yy − ρ0 g0 .

(13.10b)

Note that only ﬁrst-order partial derivatives are used in these equations.
σ yy = 0, σx y = 0

We could of course substitute the equations into each other to express the effective force in terms of
second-order derivatives of the displacement ﬁelds

f y = (λ + 2µ)∇ y u y + µ∇x u y + (λ + µ)∇x ∇ y u x − ρ0 g0 .

(13.11b)

Although there are excellent numerical methods to solve such (elliptic) differential equations, the
boundary conditions that involve stresses (see below) are not so easy to implement.

σ yx = 0
σx x = 0
u y = 0, σx y = 0

Boundary conditions for the rectangular block.

Boundary conditions
The boundary consists of the two ﬁxed surfaces at x = 0 and y = 0 and the free surfaces at x = a and
y = b. We shall adopt the following boundary conditions,
σx x = 0,

σ yx = 0

free surface at x = a,

(13.12a)

σ yy = 0,

σx y = 0

free surface at y = b,

(13.12b)

u x = 0,

σ yx = 0

ﬁxed wall at x = 0,

(13.12c)

u y = 0,

σx y = 0

ﬁxed wall at y = 0.

(13.12d)

Here we have assumed that the ﬁxed surfaces are slippery, so that the shear stress must vanish. That is
however not the only choice.
Had we instead chosen the ﬁxed walls to be sticky so that the elastic material were unable to slip
along the sides, the tangential displacements at these boundaries would have to vanish, i.e. u y = 0 at
x = 0 and u x = 0 at y = 0. The tangential stress σx y = σ yx would, on the other hand, be left free
to take any value determined by the ﬁeld equations. Whereas freedom appears to be unique, there is
always more than one way to constrain it.

Shear-free solution
Since the shear stress vanishes at all boundaries, it is tempting to solve the equations by requiring the shear
stress also to vanish throughout the block, σx y = σ yx = 0, as we did for the three-dimensional settling in
section 12.2. One may verify that the following ﬁeld solves the ﬁeld equations

Convergence measures
The approach towards equilibrium may, for example, be monitored by means of the integral over the square
of the effective force ﬁeld which must converge towards zero, if the algorithm works. We shall choose the

It is normalized such that χ = 1 in the undeformed state where u x = u y = 0 and thus f x = 0 and
∗
f y = −ρ0 g0 . The integral is calculated as a sum over the two-dimensional lattice (with appropriate
weighting of the boundaries). The iterative process can then be stopped when the value falls below any
desired accuracy, say χ 0.01.

Another possibility is to calculate the total energy (11.32),

with the integral replaced by a double sum over the lattice points. This quantity should decrease
monotonically towards its minimum and, since it, like χ , also has a well-deﬁned continuum limit, its
value should be relatively independent of how ﬁne-grained the discretization is, as long as the lattice
is large enough. It is, however, harder to determine the accuracy attained.

Iteration cycle
Assuming that the discretized displacement ﬁeld on the lattice (u x , u y ) satisﬁes the boundary conditions,
we may calculate the strains (u x x , u yy , u zz ) from (13.8) by means of the discrete derivatives, and the
stresses (σx x , σ yy , σx y ) from Hooke’s law (13.9). Stress boundary conditions are then imposed and the
∗ ∗
effective force ﬁeld ( f x , f y ) is calculated from (13.10). At this point the monitoring parameter χ may be
checked and if below the desired accuracy, the iteration process is terminated. If not, the corrections
∗
δu x = f x
∗
δu y = f y

(13.18)
(13.19)

are added into the displacement ﬁeld, boundary conditions are imposed on the displacement ﬁeld, and the
cycle repeats.
The iteration process may be viewed as a dynamical process which in the course of (computer) time
makes the displacement ﬁeld converge towards its equilibrium conﬁguration. The true dynamics of
deformation (see chapter 14) go on in real time and are quite different. Since dissipation in solids
is not included here, the true dynamics are unable to eat away energy and make the system relax
towards equilibrium. Releasing the block from the undeformed state, as we do here, would instead
create vibrations and sound waves that reverberate forever throughout the system.

Figure 13.1. Computed deformation of a square two-dimensional block. On the left the equilibrium
displacement ﬁeld is plotted by means of little arrows (not to scale). On the right is plotted the outline
of the deformed block. The displacement vanishes as it must at the ﬁxed walls. The protruding material
(solid line) has a slightly convex shape rather than the concave shape in the shear-free approximation (small
dashes).

Choice of parameters
Since we are mostly interested in the shape of the deformation, we may choose convenient values for the
input parameters. They are the box sides a = b = 1, the lattice sizes Nx = N y = 20, Young’s modulus
E = 2, Poisson’s ratio ν = 1/3 and the force of gravity ρ0 g0 = 1. The step-size is chosen of the form
=

ω
E

x 2 y2
x 2 + y2

(13.20)

where ω is called the convergence parameter. The reason for this choice is that the effective force is
proportional to Young’s modulus E and (due to the second-order spatial derivatives) to the inverse squares
of the grid spacings, say 1/ x 2 + 1/ y 2 = ( x 2 + y 2 )/ x 2 y 2 . The convergence parameter ω is
consequently dimensionless and may be chosen to be of order unity to get fastest convergence. In the
present computer simulation, the largest value that could be used before numeric instabilities set in was
ω = 1.

Programming hints
The ﬁelds are represented by real arrays, containing the ﬁeld values at the grid points, for example
U X[i, j ] ⇔ u x (i x, j y),

(13.21)

U Y [i, j ] ⇔ u y (i x, j y),

(13.22)

and similarly for the strain and stress ﬁelds. Allocating separate arrays for strains and stresses may seem
excessive and can be avoided, but when lattices are as small as here, it does not matter. Anyway, the days
of limited memory are over.
The iteration cycle is implemented as a loop, containing a sequence of calls to subroutines that evaluate
strains, stresses, effective forces and impose boundary conditions, followed by a step that evaluates the
monitoring parameters and ﬁnally updates the displacement arrays before the cycle repeats. The iteration
loop is terminated when the accuracy has reached the desired level, or the number of iterations has exceeded
a chosen maximum.

Results
After about 2000 iteration cycles the monitoring parameter χ has fallen from 1 to about 0.01 where it seems
to remain without further change. This is most probably due to the brute enforcing of boundary values. The

importance of the boundary which decreases like 1/ N relative to the volume.
The ﬁnal displacement ﬁeld and its inﬂuence on the outline of the original box is shown in ﬁgure 13.1.
One notes how the displacement does not penetrate into the ﬁxed bottom wall as it did in the shear-free
approximation. In ﬁgure 13.2 the vertical pressure p y = −σ yy is plotted as a function of x in the middle
of the block (y = 0.5). Earlier we argued that there would have to be an extra normal reaction from the
bottom in order to push up the sagging solution to the shear-free equations. This is also borne out by the
plot of p y which has roughly the same shape throughout the block. Since the vertical pressure is now larger
than the weight of the column of material above, we expect that there must be a negative shear stress on the
sides of the column to balance the extra vertical pressure, as is also evident from ﬁgure 13.2.

Sound is the generic term for harmonic pressure waves in matter, be it solid, liquid or gaseous. Our daily
existence as humans, communicating in and out of sight, is strongly dependent on sound transmission in
air, and only rarely—as for example in the dentists chair—do we note the primary effects of sound in solids.
What we do experience in our daily lives are mostly secondary effects of vibrations in solids transferred to
air as sound waves, for example a mouse scratching on the other side of a wooden wall, or more insidiously
the neighbour’s drilling into concrete. There are also wave motions in elastic solids, for example caused
by earthquakes that we would hardly call sound, except sometimes one speaks about infrasound. We do
not hear these phenomena directly but rather experience an earthquake as a motion of the ground, though
usually accompanied by audible sound.
There are actually two kinds of vibrations in isotropic elastic solids: longitudinal pressure waves and
transverse shear waves. The two kinds of waves are transmitted with different phase velocities because
elastic materials respond differently to pressure and shear stress. Vibrations in ideal elastic materials do
not dissipate energy, but energy can be lost to spatial inﬁnity through radiation of sound. A church bell or
tuning fork may ring for a long time but eventually stops because of radiative and dissipative losses.
In this chapter we shall use Newton’s second law to derive the basic equations for small-amplitude
vibrations in isotropic elastic materials and then apply them to a few generic situations. Elastic vibrations
constitute a huge subﬁeld of continuum physics which cannot be given just treatment in a single chapter.
The chapter is, however, important because it is the ﬁrst time we encounter continuous matter in motion,
the main theme for the remainder of this book.

14.1 Elastodynamics
The instantaneous state of a deformable material is described by a time-dependent displacement ﬁeld u(x, t)
which indicates how much a material particle at time t is displaced from its original position x. The ﬁeld
u(x, t) should as before be understood as the displacement from a chosen reference state which may itself
already be highly stressed and deformed. There are, for example, huge static stresses in balance with gravity
in the pylons and girders of a bridge, but when the wind acts on the bridge, small-amplitude vibrations may
arise around the static state.
In this section we shall ﬁrst establish the fundamental equation of motion for isotropic elastic matter
and then draw some general conclusions about the nature of its solutions. Some of the results to be derived
will have much wider application than just for elastic waves.

Navier’s equation of motion
The actual position of a displaced particle is x = x + u(x, t), and since its original position x is timeindependent, its actual velocity is v(x, t) = ∂ u(x, t)/∂t and its acceleration w(x, t) = ∂ 2 u(x, t)/∂t 2 .

14. ELASTIC VIBRATIONS
Newton’s second law—mass times acceleration equals force—applied to every material particle in the body
takes the form, d Mw = f ∗ d V . Dividing by d V and reusing the effective force density for an isotropic
homogeneous elastic material from the left-hand side of the equation of equilibrium (12.2), we arrive at
Navier’s equation of motion (1821),
ρ

∂2u
= f + µ∇ 2 u + (λ + µ)∇∇ · u.
∂t2

(14.1)

Here λ, µ, and ρ are, as before, assumed to be material parameters that do not depend on space and time.
In the case that they depend on the spatial position x , as they do in Earth’s solid mantle, Navier’s equation
of motion takes a somewhat different form (see problem 14.1). The above equation of motion reduces by
construction to Navier’s equilibrium equation for a time-independent displacement. As in elastostatics, the
displacement ﬁeld and the stress vector must be continuous across material interfaces.
It must be emphasized that Navier’s equation of motion is only valid in the limit of small and smooth
displacement ﬁelds. If the displacement gradients are large, nonlinear terms will ﬁrst of all appear
in the strain tensor (10.44), but there will also arise nonlinear terms from the derivatives of the stress
tensor in the effective force, as demonstrated by equation (12.3). In chapter 15 we shall derive the
correct equations of motion for continuous matter (in the Euler representation) with all such terms
included.

Driving forces, dissipation and free waves
Time-dependent displacement is often caused by contact forces that—like the wind on the bridge—impose
time-dependent stresses on the surface of a body. If you hit a nail with a hammer or stroke the strings of a
violin, time-varying displacement ﬁelds are also set up in the material. Body forces may likewise drive timedependent displacements. The Moon’s tidal deformation of the rotating Earth is caused by time-dependent
gravitational body forces, acting on top of the static gravitational force of Earth itself. Magnetostrictive,
electrostrictive and piezoelectric materials deform under the inﬂuence of electromagnetic ﬁelds, and are,
for example, used in loudspeakers to set up vibrations that can be transmitted to air as sound.
The omnipresent forces of dissipation—not included in Navier’s equation of motion—will in the
end make all vibrations die out and turn their energy into heat. Sustained vibrations in any body can
strictly speaking only be maintained by time-dependent external forces continually performing work by
interacting with the body. Dissipation is nevertheless so small in most elastic materials that it, to a very
good approximation, can be omitted, as it is in Navier’s equation of motion. This argument justiﬁes the
study of free elastic waves in a body subject only to time-independent external forces. Due to the linearity
of Navier’s equation of motion, a time-independent body force may be removed by means of a suitable
time-independent displacement, such that the general equation of motion for free elastic waves becomes,
ρ

∂2u
= µ∇ 2 u + (λ + µ)∇∇ · u.
∂t 2

(14.2)

Although free waves must at some point in time have been created by time-dependent driving forces, they
will in a ﬁnite, isolated, perfectly elastic body continue indeﬁnitely after the driving forces cease to act.

The violin paradox: How can stroking a violin string with a horsehair bow at constant speed
make the string vibrate at a nearly constant frequency, when we claim that sustained vibration
demands time-dependent driving forces?
Although the external force delivered by your arm to the bow is nearly constant for the length of
the stroke, the interaction between the bow and the string develops time-dependence because of the
ﬁnite difference between static and dynamic friction forces (section 9.1). The string sticks to the
bow when it starts to move until the restoring elastic force in the string surpasses the static friction
force, whereupon the string slips and begins to move with much smaller or even no friction (if it
lifts off the bow). Swinging once back and forth the string eventually again matches the speed of
the bow and sticks. Since it only sticks for a very short time, the frequency generated in this way
is very nearly equal to the natural oscillation frequency of a taught but otherwise free string. This
stick-slip mechanism underlies many oscillatory phenomena apparently generated by steady driving
agents (see for example problem 9.9 on page 120).

Longitudinal and transverse waves
An arbitrary vector ﬁeld may always be resolved into longitudinal and transverse components (see problem
14.5),
u = u L + uT ,

(14.3)

where the longitudinal component u L has no curl, and the transverse component uT has no divergence,
∇ × uL = 0

∇ · u T = 0.

(14.4)

By the ‘double-cross’ rule (2.67) on page 26 it follows that ∇ × (∇ × u L ) = ∇(∇ · u L ) − ∇ 2 u L = 0, or
∇∇ · u L = ∇ 2 u L , so that the wave equation (14.2) specialized to purely longitudinal and transverse free
waves becomes,
ρ

∂2uL
= (λ + 2µ)∇ 2 u L ,
∂t2

ρ

∂ 2 uT
= µ∇ 2 u T .
∂t2

(14.5)

Conversely it may be shown that the longitudinal and transverse components of any mixed ﬁeld (14.3) must
also satisfy these equations (see problem 14.5).
Both of these equations are in the form of the standard wave equation,
∂2u
= c2 ∇ 2 u,
∂t2

(14.6)

for non-dispersive waves with phase velocity c. For longitudinal and transverse waves the phase velocities
are,
cL =

λ + 2µ
,
ρ

cT =

ρ

(14.7)

In typical elastic materials the phase velocities are a few kilometres per second which is an order of
magnitude greater than the velocity of sound in air, but roughly of the same magnitude as the sound velocity
in liquids, such as water.
The ratio between the transversal and longitudinal velocities is a useful dimensionless parameter,
q=

µ

1 − 2ν
.
2(1 − ν)

(14.8)

It depends only on Poisson’s ratio ν , and is a monotonically decreasing function of ν . Its maximal value
√
(1/2) 3 ≈ 0.87 is obtained for ν = −1, implying that the transverse velocity is always smaller than the
longitudinal one. In practice there are no materials with ν < 0, so the realizable upper limit to the ratio
√
is instead (1/2) 2 ≈ 0.71. For a typical value ν = 1/3 we get q = 1/2 and hence longitudinal waves
typically propagate with double the speed of transverse waves.
The tiny pressure change (11.14) generated by the displacement ﬁeld is p = −K ∇ · u, where
K = λ + 2/3µ is the bulk modulus. Since ∇ · u = 0 for transverse waves, only the longitudinal
waves are accompanied by an oscillating pressure. They are for this reason also called pressure waves
or compressional waves. Transverse waves generate no pressure changes in the material, only shear, and
are therefore called shear waves.
Finally, it must be emphasized that although the longitudinal and transverse displacement ﬁelds
individually satisfy the standard wave equation, the boundary conditions on the surface of a body must
be applied to the complete displacement ﬁeld (14.3). The boundary conditions will thus in general couple
the longitudinal and transverse components, the only exception being plane waves in an inﬁnitely extended
medium.

Earthquake wave types: In earthquakes (see ﬁgure 14.1) pressure waves are denoted P (for
primary), because they arrive ﬁrst due to the higher longitudinal phase velocity in any material.
Typically they move at speeds of 4–7 km s−1 in the Earth’s crust. Shear waves move at roughly
half the speed and thus arrive later at the seismometer. They are for this reason denoted by S (for
secondary). In ﬂuid material, such as the Earth’s liquid core, shear waves cannot propagate. Besides
these body waves, earthquakes are also accompanied by surface waves to be discussed in section
14.3.

Harmonic analysis
A general mathematical theorem due to Fourier tells us that any time-dependent function may be
resolved as a superposition of harmonic or monochromatic components, each oscillating with a single
frequency. For linear differential equations—ordinary or partial—with time-independent coefﬁcients this
is particularly advantageous because it reduces the time-dependent problem to a time-independent one (for
each frequency).
A real harmonic displacement ﬁeld with circular frequency ω and period 2π/ω satisﬁes the equation,
∂2u
= −ω2 u.
∂t 2

(14.9)

The most general solution is a linear superposition of two time-independent standing wave ﬁelds u1 (x) and
u2 (x),
u(x, t) = u1 (x) cos ωt + u2 (x) sin ωt.

(14.10)

Instead of working with two real ﬁelds it is often most convenient to collect them in a single complex
time-independent standing-wave ﬁeld,
u(x) = u1 (x) + i u2 (x).

(14.11)

The harmonic displacement ﬁeld then becomes the real part of a complex ﬁeld,
u(x, t) = Êe u(x) e−iωt .

(14.12)

The displacement velocity is correspondingly given by the imaginary part,
∂ u(x, t)
= ω Á m u(x) e−iωt ,
∂t
as may easily be veriﬁed.

wave; the displacement oscillates in the direction of motion. (b) Transversal wave; the displacement
oscillates orthogonally to the direction of motion.
Since the wave equation (14.2) is linear in u, it is also satisﬁed by the velocity ﬁeld ∂ u/∂t and thus
by both the real and imaginary part of the complex ﬁeld u(x)e−iωt , i.e. by the whole complex ﬁeld itself.
Inserting this ﬁeld into the wave equation we obtain a single time-independent equation for the complex
standing-wave ﬁeld u(x),
−ρω2 u = µ∇ 2 u + (λ + µ)∇∇ · u.

(14.14)

It may be viewed as an eigenvalue equation for the operator µδi j ∇ 2 + (λ + µ)∇i ∇ j with eigenfunction
u(x) and −ρω2 as the eigenvalue. It may be shown that ω2 is always real and positive (problem 14.4). In a
ﬁnite body, the boundary conditions only allow solutions for a discrete set of eigenfrequencies, whereas in
an inﬁnite medium the eigenfrequencies normally form a continuum.
The harmonic analysis may immediately be extended to Navier’s equation of motion with a timedependent body force ﬁeld f (x, t). This will only add the complex harmonic amplitude f (x) of the force
ﬁeld to the right-hand side of (14.14).

Plane waves
Plane waves have inﬁnite extension, and inﬁnitely extended material bodies do not exist. Nevertheless,
deeply inside a ﬁnite body, far from the boundaries, conditions are almost as if the body were inﬁnite, and
the displacement ﬁeld may be resolved into a superposition of independent longitudinal or transverse plane
waves. The condition for this to be possible is that the typical wavelengths contained in the wave should be
much smaller than the dimensions of the body or the distance to boundaries.
It is instructive to carry through the harmonic analysis for a plane harmonic wave, described by (the
real part of) a complex harmonic ﬁeld of the form,
u = a ei(k·x−ωt ) .

(14.15)

Here a is the generally complex amplitude or polarization vector, k the wave vector and ω the circular
frequency. The wave’s direction of propagation is k/ |k|, its wavelength 2π/ |k| and its period 2π/ω. The
phase of the wave is k · x − ωt and its phase velocity ω/ |k|. Inserting this ﬁeld into (14.2) (or just aei k·x
into (14.14)), we obtain,
ρω2 a = µk 2 a + (λ + µ)kk · a.

(14.16)

This is a simple eigenvalue equation for the real symmetric (3 × 3) matrix µk2 δi j + (λ + µ)ki k j , with
eigenvector a and eigenvalue ρω2 .

The two other eigenvectors are transverse with amplitudes orthogonal to the wave vector, i.e. k · a = 0, and
it follows from (14.16) that ρω2 = µk2 . The transverse harmonic plane wave is therefore of the form (see

where n1 and n2 are mutually orthogonal transverse vectors (both orthogonal to k), and A 1 and A 2 are
arbitrary complex numbers representing the transverse amplitudes.
Fourier’s theorem applied to both space and time variables tells us that the most general solution to the
wave equation (14.2) is (the real part of) a superposition of longitudinal and transverse plane waves with
different frequencies, directions of propagation and amplitudes.

14.2 Refraction and reﬂection
The simplest system which differs from an inﬁnitely extended medium consists of two semi-inﬁnite media
interfacing along a plane. The materials on both sides of the interface are homogeneous and isotropic, but
have different longitudinal and transverse phase velocities, c L , cT and c L , cT . A plane wave incident on one
side of the interface will give rise to both a refracted wave on the other side and a reﬂected wave on the same
side. Even if the incident wave is purely longitudinal or purely transverse, the refracted and reﬂected waves
will in general be superpositions of longitudinal and transverse waves propagating in different directions.
In this section we shall investigate some aspects of these waves which even in this simplest non-trivial case
are rather complicated.

(triangulation), and discovered
the law of refraction.

Taking the interface to be the x y-plane, z = 0 of the coordinate system, the planar geometry is
translationally invariant in all directions along x and y. That permits us to resolve the displacement ﬁeld on
either side into a superposition of plane waves of the form (14.15) where all the components have the same
ﬁxed values of ω, k x and k y on both sides of the interface, whereas in the z-direction the waves may have
different values of k z and k z . From this we conclude that the refracted and reﬂected waves propagate in the
same plane as the incident wave. In the following we shall, without loss of generality, choose the waves to
propagate in the xz-plane with k y = 0 and k x ≥ 0.
A simple geometric construction shows that the angle between the normal to the interface and the
direction of propagation of any plane wave with phase velocity c = ω/ |k| is given by

14.2. REFRACTION AND REFLECTION

179

This relation applies to any combination of plane wave components whether they are longitudinal or
transverse, on the same side (ipsilateral) as for reﬂection or on opposite sides (contralateral) as for refraction.
Since c L > cT we always have θ L > θT for the ipsilateral longitudinal and transverse components of a
refracted or reﬂected wave. Reﬂected and incident waves of the same type will have the same angles with
the normal. The angles of contralateral components are determined by the different material properties of
the interfacing media, and cannot be generally characterized.
Snell’s law takes the same form for elastic, acoustic and electromagnetic waves. The fact that light
moves with smaller phase velocity in water than in air immediately tells us that a light ray passing
the plane water surface has a smaller angle with the normal in water than in air, thereby explaining
the familiar observation that a straight rod apparently breaks when it is partially immersed into water.
If the interface is curved we expect that Snell’s law will be valid for wavelengths much smaller than
the radii of curvature of the interface.
A peculiar thing happens when a refracted wave passes from lower to higher phase velocity, c > c
(which it will always do from one side of the interface). By increasing the angle of incidence there will be
a maximal incidence angle θmax satisfying sin θmax = c/c where the refraction angle becomes θ = 90 ◦ ,
and the wave appears to crawl along the interface. For θ > θmax the incident wave is completely unable to
penetrate the interface and is totally reﬂected. Comparing with (14.20) total reﬂection is seen to correspond
to imaginary values of the refracted wave vector component k z . A similar phenomenon takes place for
reﬂection in isotropic elastic media when the incident wave is transverse. The reﬂected longitudinal wave
always has larger velocity than the reﬂected transverse wave, and there will be a maximal incident angle for
longitudinal reﬂection. Beyond that angle, the reﬂected wave will be purely transverse.

An incident transverse wave produces a reﬂected transverse wave

Total reﬂection is well known to divers looking at the water surface from below, or to ﬁsh looking
at you from inside their aquarium. It is also of great importance for the functioning of optical ﬁbers

(14.22b)

A single incident longitudinal or transverse wave can, in principle, generate one longitudinal and two
transverse waves on either side of the interface. The amplitudes of the six waves are determined by the
six boundary conditions. Intuitively it is fairly clear that ‘supertransverse’ waves polarized orthogonally to
the plane of incidence (i.e. along the y-direction) must decouple from the others which only involve the xand z-directions. We therefore only face four equations with four unknowns for the waves with polarization
in the plane of incidence, or two equations with two unknowns for the ‘super-transverse’ waves. It is still
an unpleasant task to solve four equations with four unknowns, so in the remainder of this section we shall
limit the analysis to a couple of cases resulting in only two equations with two unknowns.

In a ‘supertransverse’ wave the incident as well as the reﬂected and refracted components are polarized
along e y = (0, 1, 0). It is convenient to set k x = k and deﬁne k T =
(ω/cT )2 − k 2 and
k T = (ω/cT )2 − k 2 . Leaving out the common factor ei(kx−ωt ) , the only non-vanishing displacement
components are,
u y = A eikT z .

(14.23)

The ﬁrst term in u y represents the incident ﬁeld, normalized to unity, while the second term represents the
reﬂected wave with amplitude A. The ﬁeld u y consists entirely of the refracted wave with amplitude A .

For the ‘supertransverse’ wave (14.23) the solution is trivial. We simply take A = 0 and ﬁnd A = 1, such
that u y ∼ cos(k T z).
For a ‘normal’ transverse wave the ﬁeld is more complicated, because it can contain both longitudinal
and transverse reﬂected components. Apart from an overall oscillating factor ei(kx−ωt ) the ﬁeld is of the
form,
u = (−k T , 0, k)eikT z + A T (k T , 0, k)e−ikT z + A L (k, 0, −k L )e−ik L z ,

(14.30)

where A T and A L are the amplitudes of the reﬂected longitudinal and transverse ﬁelds, and where as before
k T = (ω/cT )2 − k 2 and k L = (ω/c L )2 − k 2 . It may readily be veriﬁed that the longitudinal ﬁeld is a
gradient, and the transverse ﬁelds have no divergence (remembering the oscillating factor ei(kx−ωt ) ).

This clearly shows that a transverse incident wave produces a longitudinal reﬂected wave for sin θ < q,

The case of a longitudinal incident wave is very similar and is analysed in problem 14.2. In ﬁgure 14.4

motion of the surface. Note the exponential decay of the wave under the surface.

∗ 14.3 Surface waves
At a material interface there are special types of waves which do not penetrate into the bulk of the materials,
but decay exponentially with the distance from the interface. We have already seen in the preceding section,
how such wave components can arise in the refraction of an incident wave into a material with larger phase
velocity when the angle of incidence becomes large enough. In this section we shall consider two kinds of
free surface waves, Rayleigh waves and Love waves. Both have geophysical signiﬁcance, in particular in
relation to earthquakes where they arise when seismic bulk waves encounter the surface of the Earth.

Rayleigh waves
The most general exponentially decaying superposition of normal transverse and a longitudinal surface
wave in the lower half space z < 0 is (apart from the oscillating factor exp(i(kx − ωt)) which is common
to both terms),
u = A T (iκT , 0, k)eκT z + A L (k, 0, −iκ L )eκ L z ,

where A T and A L are generally complex constants. It is obtained from the general expression (14.30)
by leaving out the incident wave (which diverges exponentially) and setting k T = iκT with κT =
k 2 − (ω/cT )2 and k L = iκ L with κ L = k 2 − (ω/c L )2 . Both κT and κ L are real for k > ω/cT ,
because cT < c L . One may verify directly that the longitudinal wave is indeed a gradient ﬁeld, and that the
transverse wave is free of divergence.
The free surface boundary conditions are the same as in the preceding section σx z = σzz = 0 for
z = 0, and leaving out the terms due to the incident wave on the right-hand side of (14.32), we ﬁnd from
the left-hand side,
2
2ikκ L A L − (k 2 + κT )A T = 0,

(14.37)

2
(k 2 + κT )A L + 2ikκT A T = 0.

Since i A L /A T = (k 2 + κT )/2kκ L = 2kκT /(k 2 + κT ), these equations only have a non-vanishing solution

values, q < 1/ 2 ≈ 0.7, the phase velocity is nearly equal to the phase velocity of transverse waves.
(b) Ratio of longitudinal and transverse amplitudes as a function of q .
The simplest way to solve this equation is to square it and isolate the ratio q = cT /c L in terms of the ratio
ξ = c/cT ,

.
16(1 − ξ 2 )

(14.41)

In ﬁgure 14.6(a ) the phase velocity ξ of Rayleigh waves has been plotted as a function of q . The maximal
value ξ0 = 0.955313 . . . is the real root of the polynomial in the numerator under the square root.
Typical values of q are around 0.5, showing that the value of ξ is close to unity in all practical cases.
Expanding (14.41) to lowest order near ξ = 1 we ﬁnd the approximation
ξ =1−

1
2(11 − 16q 2 )

which for q = 0.5 is better than 1%. The phase velocity of Rayleigh waves is thus normally just a little
below the phase velocity of free transverse waves.
Seismic waves created deep inside the Earth’s crust are reﬂected from the surface. If the angle of
incidence is large enough, the transverse components will excite Rayleigh waves running along the
surface. Since their speed is slightly lower than the transverse waves, they arrive even later than
S-waves at a seismometer (if they originate in the same point). During the passing of a Rayleigh
wave, the surface suffers a combination of compressional and vertical shear displacements, much
like a wave rolling across the sea (see ﬁgures 14.5 and 14.1). Horizontal shear displacements are
absent in a Rayleigh wave.

Love waves
One could think that there might be ‘supertransverse’ free surface waves, either at a free surface or at a
material interface, but neither of these types are in fact possible (see problem 14.3). Love found, however,
in 1911 that supertransverse free waves may be created if the surface material is heterogeneous with elastic
properties that change with height z.
The simplest geometry is obtained by placing a layer of material of thickness h situated on top of a
material ﬁlling the half-space z < 0. Under the conditions that cT > cT and ω/cT < k < ω/cT there
will be a solution which is exponentially damped in the lower half-space and has running waves in the
upper layer. Anticipating that the stress, σ yz = µ ∇z u y , must vanish at the top of the layer, z = h, a
supertransverse ﬁeld takes the following form in the two media,
u y = AeκT z ,
k 2 − (ω/cT )2 = k

u y = A cos k T (h − z),

For any value of the phase velocity in the interval cT < c < cT this permits us to calculate the value of
kh and—since h is assumed known—of ω = ck . Conversely, for a given frequency ω one may solve this
equation for the allowed values of c. The inﬁnity of branches of inverse tangent yields an inﬁnite number
of possible frequencies for a given phase velocity. Conversely, there are only a ﬁnite number of allowed
phase velocities for a given frequency. The solutions c/cT are plotted in ﬁgure 14.7(a ) as functions of
the dimensionless frequency parameter ωh/cT for a choice of material parameters. In ﬁgure 14.7(b) the
amplitude ratio A/ A is plotted as a function of the phase velocity parameter c/cT .
A surface layer thus acts like a wave guide for Love waves. Contrary to Rayleigh waves, Love waves
are dispersive, with phase velocity that depends on the wavelength (or frequency). Since cT < c < cT Love
waves move faster than Rayleigh waves in the surface layer, but slower than shear waves in the bulk. Love
waves thus arrive before the Rayleigh waves originating in the same point (see ﬁgure 14.1). In earthquakes
Love waves are the most destructive because of the shearing motion of the surface layer which is not well
tolerated by buildings.

The running water in a brook, the streaming wind and the rolling sea are all examples of ﬂuids in motion.
A waterfall is a vivid illustration of the richness of ﬂuid motion. It is one of the wonders of nature that all
this richness is ‘just’ a consequence of Newton’s equations of motion applied to continuous matter. Easy to
write down, these equations only have analytic solutions in a number of idealized and highly constrained
situations. Nevertheless, such solutions offer valuable insights into ﬂuid dynamics which is otherwise
accessible only by experiments and computer calculations.
The motion of solids is generally less rich than ﬂuid motion, and it is precisely for this reason that
solids are used to build structures like houses, bridges and machines. It is also the reason that the study
of continuous systems in this book started with elasticity. Fluids and solids are extremes in the world of
continuous matter, and there are many transition materials with properties in between. In this chapter we
shall analyse matter in motion without distinguishing between particular types of matter, although in the
back of our minds we shall mostly think of ﬂuids.
Two basic mechanical equations govern the motion of continuous matter. One concerns conservation
of mass and states that the only way the mass of a volume of matter can change is through ﬂow of material
across its surface. The other is Newton’s second law applied to continuous systems. Together with suitable
expressions for the forces at play in the material, we arrive at a complete set of equations of motion for the
mass density and velocity ﬁelds. In this chapter we shall only apply them to the whole universe, and show
that they lead to a surprisingly sensible cosmology. Later chapters will deal with much more earthly aspects
of ﬂuid dynamics.

15.1 The velocity ﬁeld
In trying to deﬁne a velocity ﬁeld v(x, t) we are faced with the problem that the molecules, especially in
the gaseous state, move rapidly around among each other, even in matter ‘at rest’, and this motion must
somehow be averaged out. Newtonian particle mechanics tells us that the centre of mass of a collection of
particles moves as a single particle with mass equal to the total mass of all the particles and acted upon by
the total force (see appendix A). The only meaningful deﬁnition of the velocity v of a material particle is,
therefore, that it should represent the centre of mass velocity of the collection of molecules contained in it,
for then the total momentum of a material particle of mass d M occupying a volume d V near the point x at
time t will be,
d

È = v(x, t) d M = v ρ d V.

(15.1)

Identifying the velocity ﬁeld with the centre of mass velocity of material particles permits us to apply
Newtonian particle mechanics to the material particles themselves without thinking too much about their
internal structure.

A streamline is everywhere tangent to the velocity ﬁeld at a
given time t0 .

The velocity ﬁeld is like the mass density a ﬂuctuating quantity obtained from an average over nearly
random individual molecular contributions. In problem 1.4 on page 11 it was shown that, provided the
linear dimension of the material particle is larger than the micro scale (1.2), the ﬂuctuation in centre of
mass velocity relative to the typical molecular velocity will be smaller than the measurement precision.
Example 15.1.1: The velocity ﬁeld of a non-rotating rigid body moving with constant velocity U is
v(x, t) = U. If instead the body is rotating around the origin of the coordinate system with constant
angular velocity vector , the velocity ﬁeld is v(x, t) = × x.

Methods of ﬂow visualization
Wind and water currents are normally invisible unless polluted by foreign matter. A gentle breeze in the air
can be observed from the motion of dust particles dancing in the sunshine or the undulations of smoke from
a cigarette. Even a tornado ﬁrst becomes visible when water vapour condenses near its centre or debris is
picked up and thrown around. Modern technology does, on the other hand, permit us indirectly to ‘see’
velocity ﬁelds. Doppler radar is used for tracking and visualizing damaging winds in violent storms, and
likewise, Doppler acoustics is used to visualize blood ﬂow in the heart.

Little arrows: The instantaneous velocity ﬁeld is often visualized by means of little arrows attached to
a regular grid of points, each of a length and direction proportional to the velocity ﬁeld in the point (see
ﬁgure 15.1). Sometimes it is more illustrative and permits ﬁner ﬂow details to be seen if the arrows are
drawn from a random selection of points, because the density of arrows can be higher.
Streamlines: In section 3.2 we discussed how the gravitational ﬁeld could be visualized by means of
ﬁeld lines, deﬁned to be curves that everywhere had the gravitational ﬁeld at a ﬁxed time as tangent. Similar
ﬁeld lines, called streamlines, can be deﬁned for the velocity ﬁeld as curves that are everywhere tangent to
the velocity ﬁeld at a ﬁxed time. Such curves are solutions to the ordinary differential equation
dx
= v(x, t0 ),
dt

(15.2)

where the velocity ﬁeld is calculated for a ﬁxed value of time t0 . Starting at any point x 0 at t = t0 we
may use this equation to determine the path x = x(t, x 0 , t0 ) of a streamline. Because the velocity ﬁeld is
evaluated at a ﬁxed moment in time t0 there will be only one tangent and thus only one streamline through
every point of space. Streamlines depict the velocity ﬁeld at a single instant in time and can never intersect.

15.1. THE VELOCITY FIELD

191

Particle trajectories: Imagine you drop a tiny particle—a speck of dust—into a ﬂuid, and watch how
it is carried along with the ﬂuid in its motion. The speck of dust should be neutrally buoyant in the ﬂuid,
and so small that its inertia and mass play no role but on the other hand so large that it is not buffeted
around much by collisions with individual molecules (i.e. by Brownian motion). The path x = x(t) which
it follows is called a particle trajectory or orbit and is determined by the differential equation,
dx
= v(x, t).
dt

(15.3)

Given a starting point x 0 and a starting time t0 , the path x(t, x 0 , t0 ) may be calculated from this equation
for all times t. There will be only one particle orbit going through each point in space at a ﬁxed instant, but
different orbits may cross each other and even themselves as long as this occurs at different times.

Streaklines: A standard method for visualizing ﬂuid ﬂow in, for example, wind tunnels, is to inject
smoke (or dye) into the ﬂuid at a constant rate. This leads to streaklines of smoke weaving through the ﬂuid.
Since smoke particles are tiny and light they must follow particle orbits, so that a streakline is obtained from
the particle orbit x(t, x 0 , t0 ) by varying the start time t0 while keeping ﬁxed the observation time t and the
point x 0 from which the smoke emanates.

A particle orbit is everywhere

Relating the various ﬂow lines
For a time-dependent velocity ﬁeld the relationship between the three types of lines can be hard to visualize.
For steady ﬂow, where the velocity ﬁeld is independent of time, v(x, t) = v(x), the particle orbits evidently
coincide with the streamlines, and since the streamlines in this case can only depend on the time difference
t − t0 , the streaklines will also coincide with them. One should always remember that streamlines are quite
misleading for unsteady ﬂow.
Example 15.1.2 (Streamlines, streaklines, particle orbits): To illustrate the difference between the
three types of ﬁeld lines consider a spatially uniform two-dimensional velocity ﬁeld of the form
v(x, t) = (a, bt, 0)

(15.4)

where the y-component everywhere grows linearly with t. The stream lines are in this case determined
by

15. FLUIDS IN MOTION

15.2 Incompressible ﬂow
Most solids and liquids are fairly incompressible under ordinary circumstances and, as we shall see later,
gases will often be effectively incompressible when ﬂow speeds are much smaller than the velocity of
sound. One should, however, not forget that all materials are in principle compressible. Incompressibility is
always an approximation, and should be viewed as a condition on the ﬂow rather than an absolute material
property. It is nevertheless such an important condition that we shall devote large parts of the remainder of
this book to the study of incompressible ﬂows.

Let V be a ﬁxed volume of matter with surface S . In a small time interval δ t , all the material particles
in V are simultaneously displaced by v( x, t) δt to ﬁll out another volume V in the vicinity of the
original volume. Since a surface element d S is displaced through the vector distance vδ t , it scoops up
an inﬁnitesimal volume vδ t · d S (counted with sign), so that the total change in volume becomes

V

A comoving volume expands in
a diverging velocity ﬁeld, and
contracts in a converging ﬁeld.

(15.9)

The reason for the special notation for the material time derivative, D/Dt, is that this is not an ordinary
time derivative1 . It represents the would-be instantaneous rate of change of a volume following along with
the ﬂow of matter, a so-called comoving volume. Here it is calculated using a ﬁxed volume, but since the
integral only depends on the instantaneous shape of the volume, it does not matter whether afterwards it
will move along with the movement of matter or not. In chapter 22 we shall generalize the formalism to
volumes that move in any way we desire.
By means of Gauss’ theorem (6.4) the surface integral may be converted to a volume integral,

The volume of a comoving material particle thus swells and shrinks according to the divergence or
convergence of the velocity ﬁeld.
Example 15.2.1 (Radial expansion): Let v = κ x be a radially expanding velocity ﬁeld. The
comoving rate of change of the volume of a sphere of radius r centred at the origin becomes,
DV
κ x · d S = 4πκr 3 ,
=
Dt
|x|=r

(15.12)

because the surface area of the sphere is 4πr 2 and its normal points along x. This could also have been
obtained by multiplying the volume (4/3)πr 3 with the constant divergence ∇ · v = 3κ.
1 There is no general agreement in the literature on how to denote the material time derivative. Some texts use the
ordinary differential operator d/dt and others use a notation like (d/dt)system , but it seems as if the notation D/Dt used
in this book is the most common.

15.2. INCOMPRESSIBLE FLOW

Incompressibility condition
Incompressibility means that any comoving volume of matter must be constant in time, DV / Dt = 0, or

S

v · d S = 0,

(15.13)

¹

for all closed surfaces. Incompressible matter cannot accumulate anywhere, and equal volumes of
incompressible matter must move in and out of any closed surface per unit of time.
Using Gauss’ theorem on (15.13) or equivalently (15.11) we ﬁnd that the divergence of the velocity
ﬁeld must vanish for incompressible ﬂow,
∇ · v = 0.

(15.14)

A divergence-free ﬁeld is sometimes called solenoidal. Note that in this local formulation the condition of
incompressibility does not refer to any volume of matter, but only to the ﬁeld itself.

A material particle is also deformed by the ﬂow because the
velocity ﬁeld varies from place to
place within it.

is incompressible, because

Due to the periodicity in both x and y, the ﬂow forms a regular array of stationary whirls, one of which
is shown in ﬁgure 15.1 on page 190. There is probably no practical way of generating this ﬂow pattern.

Leonardo’s law
Leonardo da Vinci knew—and used—that the water speed decreases when a canal or river becomes wider
and increases when it becomes narrower [70]. He discovered the simple law that the product of the crosssectional area of a canal and the ﬂow velocity in the canal is always the same.
Consider, for example, an aqueduct or canal and mark two ﬁxed planar cross sections A 1 and A 2 , both
orthogonal to the general direction of ﬂow. Leonardo’s law then says that the water velocities v1 and v2
through these cross sections must obey the relation
A 1 v1 = A 2 v2 .

(15.17)

The law expresses the rather self-evident fact that the same volume of incompressible water has to pass any
cross section of the canal per unit of time. We use it all the time when dealing with water.
Leonardo’s law follows from the global condition of incompressibility (15.13). Together with the sides
of the canal, the two cross sections deﬁne a volume to which the condition can be applied. Since no water
can ﬂow through the sides of the canal, the surface integral only receives contributions from the two cross
sections, and consequently, taking both normals along the general direction of the canal, we get
v · dS =

A2

v · dS −

A1

v · d S = 0.

(15.18)

The average ﬂow velocity through a cross section A of the canal is
vA =

1
v · d S.
A A

(15.19)

It then follows from (15.18) that the product A v A is the same everywhere along the canal. This modern
formulation of Leonardo’s law is valid independent of whether the ﬂow is orderly or turbulent.

of cross sections is 100, Leonardo’s law tells us that the speed of the liquid in the needle is about 100
times larger than the speed with which the piston of the syringe is pushed, i.e. of the order of metres per
second. No surprise that it sometimes hurts to have an injection.

Matter moves with velocity
v(x, t) through every surface
element d S near x.

Leondardo’s law is deﬁnitely not valid for compressible ﬂuids. When you pump your bicycle by pushing a
piston into a cylindric chamber ﬁlled with air, the average ﬂow velocity will decrease towards the end of the
chamber where it has to vanish, because no air can pass through there. But the cross section of the chamber
is constant, so the product of cross section and average velocity cannot be constant throughout the chamber.

15.3 Mass conservation
In Newtonian mechanics, mass is conserved. The mass of a collection of point particles (‘molecules’) can
only change by addition or removal of particles. Since all matter is made from molecules, this must mean
that the only way the mass in a given volume of continuous matter can change is by mass ﬂowing in or out
of the volume through its surface. This almost trivial remark leads to the ﬁrst of the two central equations
of continuum dynamics, the equation of continuity.

Mass ﬂux
Consider a piece of a ﬁxed open or closed surface, S. The (signed) amount of mass passing through a tiny
surface element d S in the time interval dt will be ρvdt ·d S. Integrating over the whole surface and dividing
by dt, we ﬁnd the total amount of mass transported through S per unit of time,
Q=

The only way the amount of mass
can diminish in a ﬁxed volume
V is by a net outﬂow through its
closed surface S.

ρ v · d S,

(15.20)

also called the ﬂux of mass through the surface S. According to the deﬁnition of the velocity ﬁeld (15.1) the
quantity ρ v is the density of momentum, but now we learn that it also speciﬁes how much mass that ﬂows
through a unit area in a unit of time, a quantity called the current density of mass.
Example 15.3.1 (Water hose): Water is discharged from a ﬁxed hose at a rate of Q = 1 kg s−1 .
The hose has cross section A = 1 cm2 , so that the average current density of mass at the exit of the
tube is ρv = Q/A = 10 000 kg m−2 s−1 . Since the water density is constant, ρ = 1000 kg m−2 ,
the average ﬂow speed is v = 10 m s−1 . Ignoring air resistance, the water will reach a height of
h ≈ v 2 /2g0 = 5 m, if directed vertically upwards.

Global mass conservation
Since mass can neither be created nor destroyed, the rate of gain of mass in a ﬁxed volume, V , must equal
the ﬂux of mass into the volume through its closed surface S (as usual oriented outwards),

(15.21)

This is the global equation of mass conservation for an arbitrary ﬁxed control volume. It expresses the
obvious fact that the mass you gain when you eat equals the mass of the food you pass into your mouth.
The material rate of change of mass is the sum of the rate of gain of mass in the ﬁxed volume and the
rate at which mass would be incorporated through its surface, were it comoving,

15.4. MOVING ALONG WITH THE FLOW

Local mass conservation

Gauss’ theorem (6.4) on the surface integral, to obtain
DM

V

∂ρ
+ ∇ · (ρv) d V = 0.

As this has to be true for any volume V , we conclude that mass conservation requires,
∂ρ
+ ∇ · (ρv) = 0,
∂t

(15.24)

for all points x in space and all times t. This is the equation of continuity, ﬁrst obtained by Euler (1753).
Although derived from global mass conservation applied to a ﬁxed volume, it is itself a local relation
completely without reference to macroscopic volumes.
The continuity equation applies to all locally conserved quantities, for example electric charge. In
general it relates the local rate of change of the density of a quantity, here ∂ρ/∂t, to the divergence of its
current density, here ∇ · (ρv).
Example 15.3.2 (Bicycle pump): A piston is pushed into an air-ﬁlled cylindric chamber with constant
cross section A. Let its distance from the end wall be x = a(t) at time t. If the piston moves
slowly enough (compared to the velocity of sound), the density is the same throughout the chamber,
ρ(t) = M/Aa(t), where M is the (constant) mass of the air in the chamber. It is reasonable to assume
that only the x-component of the velocity ﬁeld is non-vanishing, and the equation of continuity becomes
(with a dot denoting the time derivative),

When you pull at the piston, a > 0, the velocity grows linearly with the position x along the chamber,

and conversely.

15.4 Moving along with the ﬂow
How does the environment look from the point of view of a small object riding along with the motion of
the material? A speck of dust being sucked into a vacuum cleaner will ﬁnd itself in a region with higher
air velocity and lower pressure and density than outside, even if the ﬂow of air is completely steady with
air velocity, pressure and density being constant in time everywhere (because you have stopped moving the
head of the cleaner). The ambient ﬂow of matter may thus contribute to changes in physical quantities in
the neighbourhood of comoving particles.

Local material rate of change of density
A particle near the point x at time t riding along with the ﬂow will at time t = t + δt have been displaced
to the point x = x + v(x, t)δt. Expanding to ﬁrst order in δt we ﬁnd the change in mass density

As before we shall introduce a special notation for this local material rate of change of the density,
Dρ
∂ρ
=
+ (v · ∇)ρ.
Dt
∂t

(15.26)

∇ · (ρv) = (v · ∇)ρ + ρ∇ · v,

(15.27)

Using the relation

we may write the equation of continuity (15.24) as
Dρ
= −ρ ∇ · v.
Dt

(15.28)

Returning to the question of incompressibility, we see that setting ∇ · v = 0 forces the comoving rate of
change to vanish. The density must thus be constant in the neighbourhood of a particle that moves along
with the incompressible ﬂow, even if the density should vary from place to place.

Rolling boulder: A rigid body, for example a boulder rolling down a mountainside, is by all
counts incompressible. Although its mass density may vary according to the mineral composition
of the rock, it stays—of course—the same in the neighbourhood of any particular mineral grain,
independent of how the boulder rolls.

Constant mass of material particle
The material rate of change of the mass d M of a material particle can be calculated from the material rate
of change (15.26) of the density and the material volume rate of change (15.11),
D(ρ d V )

In the last step we used the equation of continuity in the form (15.28). Conversely, this calculation shows
that we could have arrived at the continuity equation by postulating the constancy of the mass for every
comoving material particle.

Material time derivative operator
The material rate of change of the density (15.26) is obtained by applying the differential operator,
D
∂
=
+ v(x, t) · ∇,
Dt
∂t

(15.29)

to the density ﬁeld. This operator, called the local material time derivative, is a mixed differential operator
in time and space which can be applied to any ﬁeld. The ﬁrst term ∂/∂t represents the local rate of change
of the ﬁeld in a ﬁxed point x whereas the second part v · ∇, called the advective part, represents the effect
of following the motion of the material in the environment of the point2 .
For the trivial vector ﬁeld x we ﬁnd, for example,
Dx
= (v(x, t) · ∇)x = v(x, t).
Dt

(15.30)

The material rate of change of position thus equals the velocity ﬁeld.
2 There appears to be no universally accepted name for the advective term which in some other texts is called the
convective or inertia term.

15.5. CONTINUUM DYNAMICS

197

∗ Eulerian displacement ﬁeld
In principle we may trace back any material particle to its origin at some instant in time and speak about
its (Eulerian) displacement u( x, t) as a function of its actual position x at time t . Since the point of origin,
x 0 = x − u( x, t), is ﬁxed for any particle trajectory, we have D x 0 / Dt = 0, and thus from (15.30)
v=

Du
∂u
=
+ (v · ∇)u.
Dt
∂t

(15.31)

The velocity ﬁeld is thus the material derivative of the Eulerian displacement ﬁeld, but note that this is
an implicit equation for the velocity ﬁeld. The displacement ﬁeld is important for the mechanics of large
elastic deformations and for general viscoelastic materials having both elastic and ﬂuid properties. In this
book we shall not discuss such materials.

15.5 Continuum dynamics
Newton’s Second Law states that ‘mass times acceleration equals force’ for a point particle of ﬁxed mass.
Continuum physics is not concerned with point particles, but instead with volumes of matter of ﬁnite extent.
The smallest such volumes are the material particles, and since a comoving material particle has constant
mass it comes closest to the concept of a ﬁxed-mass point particle.

Material acceleration ﬁeld
For a comoving particle, the material derivative of the velocity ﬁeld deﬁnes the material acceleration ﬁeld,
w=

Dv
∂v
=
+ (v · ∇)v.
Dt
∂t

(15.32)

The ﬁrst term, the local acceleration ∂v/∂t, is most important for rapidly varying small-amplitude velocity
ﬁelds, such as sound waves in solids or ﬂuids (see section 16.2). The second term, the advective acceleration
(v · ∇)v, is most important for ﬂows dominated by strong spatial variations in the velocity ﬁeld.
If the ﬂow is steady, such that the local acceleration vanishes, ∂v/∂t = 0, the advective term will
be the only cause of acceleration. We become acutely aware of the advective acceleration in a little boat
approaching the rapids in a narrowing river.

Newton’s Second Law for continuous matter
Applying Newton’s Second Law to an arbitrary comoving material particle with mass d M = ρ d V , we ﬁnd
d Mw = d

,

(15.33)

where w is the material acceleration (15.32) and d is the total force acting on the particle. It was shown
in section 9.4 on page 116, that the total force on a material particle can be written as d = f ∗ d V where
fi∗ = f i +

∇ j σi j ,

(15.34)

j

is the effective force density. Dividing (15.33) by d V and inserting the acceleration ﬁeld (15.32) we arrive
at Cauchy’s equation (1827),
ρ

Dv

Dt

∂v
+ (v · ∇)v = f ∗ .
∂t

(15.35)

In conjunction with the continuity equation (15.24), this equation governs the dynamics of all continuous
matter.
Different types of materials, gases, liquids, solids etc, are characterized by different expressions for the
effective force density (15.34), in particular what concerns the part due to contact forces. The last two and
a half centuries of continuum physics have essentially ‘only’ been an exploration of the rich ramiﬁcations
of this dynamical equation.

Field equations of motion
The equation of continuity (15.24) and Cauchy’s dynamic equation may be written in the form of equations
of motion for the four ﬁeld components, ρ and the three components of v ,

(15.36b)

Knowing the density and velocity ﬁelds at a given time together with the effective body force density (which
usually also depends on these ﬁelds), the above equations allow us to calculate the rate of change of the
ﬁelds. If the forces depend on non-mechanical ﬁelds, for example the temperature, special equations of
motion are also needed for those ﬁelds to make the system complete (see chapter 30).

∗ Global dynamics
Cauchy’s equation (15.35) has been derived by applying Newton’s second law to material particles. It might
as well have been obtained by postulating the global law that the material rate of change of momentum of
any volume of matter must equal the total force acting on that volume,

È

D
=
Dt

.

(15.37)

For a ﬁxed volume, the material rate of change is as before deﬁned as the normal rate of change in the
volume plus the loss of momentum through the surface. For the i th component of momentum we have
D Èi
d
ρvi d V + ρvi v · d S.

(15.38)

Passing the time derivative into the integral and using Gauss’ theorem, we obtain a volume integral with the

∂t

∂ρ
+ ∇ · (ρv) + ρ

∂vi

(15.39)

Here the ﬁrst term vanishes because of the continuity equation for mass, and the second term becomes
fi∗ because of Cauchy’s equation, thereby proving (15.37). In chapter 22 global laws of this kind will be
derived systematically and used to obtain approximate solutions to ﬂuid mechanics problems.

In a cloud of free particles all
particles move in straight lines
with constant velocity forever.

15.6 Big Bang
A cloud of non-interacting particles, grains or fragments, is perhaps a poor model for continuous matter, but
it is nevertheless of interest to study the equations of motion for the velocity ﬁeld in this most simple case
where all volume and contact forces are absent. It may even be used as a primitive model for the expanding
universe with galaxies playing the role of grains. But the lack of interaction violates the continuum
conditions discussed in chapter 1, and no dynamic smoothing of the ﬁelds by collisions will occur. Given
a certain initial velocity any grain will like a ghost continue unhindered with the same velocity through the
cloud for all time, and thus have inﬁnite mean free path. The model should deﬁnitely be taken with a grain
of salt.

Explosion ﬁeld
Suppose that the cloud is created in an explosion where the fragments have stopped interacting immediately
after the event and now move freely away from each other. Since there are neither contact forces nor
body forces, we have f ∗ = 0, and every material particle is unaccelerated. Consequently, the comoving
acceleration (15.32) must vanish everywhere,

199

In spite of this being the simplest possible dynamical equation, it looks complicated enough, and
if presented without any other explanation, we would have some difﬁculty solving it because of its
nonlinearity.
Underneath, however, we know that it only implements the law of inertia, with all particles moving
at constant velocity along straight lines. If the explosion happened at the point x = 0 at time t = 0, the
fragments were almost instantly given random velocities in all directions. After the explosion the fragments
will be separated according to their velocities with the fastest fragments being farthest away. At time t , the
velocity of any fragment found at x must be
v( x, t) =

and similarly for the y and z components.

Hubble’s law
The explosion ﬁeld (15.41) is of the same form as Hubble’s law, which states that all galaxies move away
from us (and each other) with speeds that are proportional to their distances, in our notation written as,
v = H0 x,

(15.42)

where H0 is called the Hubble constant.
In general relativity, this law is understood as a consequence of a uniform expansion of space itself
since the initial Big Bang. In the primitive model used here, the Hubble constant equals the inverse age of
the universe H0 = 1/t. Although ﬁrst determined in 1929, it has been very difﬁcult for astronomy to settle
on a reliable experimental value for the Hubble constant. The latest value3 is 75 kilometres per second per
megaparsec or H0 ≈ 2.4 × 10−18 s−1 with an uncertainty of about 10%. The inverse comes to 1/H0 ≈ 13
billion years which agrees comfortably with the age of 12.5 billion years for the oldest stars4 . The problem
is, however, that the age of the universe determined from cosmology is model-dependent (see section 15.7),
and more conservative estimates places the age of the universe somewhere between 12 and 20 billion years.

∗ Evolution of the mass density
The shape of the localized mass distribution just before the explosion at t = 0 does not matter much for
what happens later. An explosion is a cataclysmic event where large unknown forces distribute essentially
random velocities to all the fragments of the ‘body’ of mass M0 that existed before the explosion.
After the explosion these fragments become separated according to their velocities, as described by the
explosion ﬁeld (15.41). Let us, for example, assume that the probability that a fragment has a velocity v in a
small neighbourhood d 3 v = dvx dv y dvx around v is f (v) d 3 v, where the probability density is normalized,
f (v) d 3 v = 1.

15. FLUIDS IN MOTION
The fragments given the velocity v in d 3 v will have mass d M = M0 f (v)d 3 v, and since they are found at

It is not hard to show (problem 15.7) that the total mass equals M0 and that this density satisﬁes the equation

15.7 Newtonian cosmology
Continuing our investigation of the expanding universe, we now wish to include the gravitational ﬁeld in
the dynamical equation (15.35), but still allow no contact forces, so that f ∗ = ρ g. The equation of motion
then becomes

been increasingly replaced by the more ‘democratic’ view that the Earth, the Sun, the Galaxy are common
members of the universe of no particular distinction (except that we live here!). The end of this line of
thought is the extreme Copernican view that for cosmological considerations every place in the universe is
as good as any other. As we shall see, this ‘Cosmological Principle’ or ‘Principle of Cosmic Democracy’ is
quite useful.

Mass density: It immediately follows from this principle that at a particular instant of time t, the
(average) mass density cannot depend on where you are, and must thus be the same everywhere,
ρ(x, t) = ρ(t).

(15.46)

Velocity ﬁeld: The Hubble expansion of the universe,
v(x, t) = H (t) x,

(15.47)

with a time-dependent Hubble ‘constant’, H (t), does not look ‘democratic’ because it seems to single out
the centre of the coordinate system. It is, in fact, completely democratic, because
v(x, t) − v( y, t) = H (t)(x − y).

(15.48)

This means that an observer in a galaxy at point y will also see the other galaxies recede from him according
to the same Hubble law as ours.

Field of gravity: Can gravity be democratic? In Newtonian cosmology it is not possible to view the
universe as a homogeneous whole when it comes to gravity. What is gravity in an inﬁnite universe?
Symmetry would seem to argue that it should vanish, because there is as much matter pulling from one
side as from the opposite, but is that right?
To overcome this problem, let us for a while think of the universe as a huge sphere with vacuum outside
and centred somewhere, perhaps right here, and let us put the origin of the coordinate system at the centre of
this sphere. In that case, we have seen in section 6.2 that the strength of gravity at a given point x depends

only on the amount of mass, M(r ) = (4/3)πr 3 ρ, inside the sphere with radius r = |x|, whereas one may
forget the mass outside this radius. In other words, the ﬁeld of gravity is
g(x, t) = −

Gρ(t) x.

(15.49)

Interestingly, by the same argument as for the velocity, an observer in another galaxy at y will see a similar
gravitational acceleration ﬁeld around himself

g(x, t) − g( y, t) = − π Gρ(t)(x − y),

(15.50)

as if he/she/it were also at the centre of the universe. This observer may, however, not think of his universe
as a huge sphere centred on himself, but must concede that our galaxy is special, at least as long as he
subscribes to Newtonian physics. In general relativity, this problem happily goes away.

Cosmological equations
Using ∇ · x = 3, we obtain from (15.47) and the equation of continuity (15.24)
ρ = −3Hρ,
˙

(15.51)

where as before a dot denotes differentiation with respect to time. Similarly, inserting (15.47) into (15.45)
and using (x · ∇)x = x, this equation becomes, after removal of a common factor x
4π
˙
H + H 2 = − Gρ.

(15.52)

Newtonian cosmology thus reduces to just two coupled ordinary differential equations for the mass density
and the Hubble ‘constant’. Note that the reference to the centre of the universe has disappeared completely,
and we may from now on again think of a truly inﬁnite universe with equal rights for all observers.

The cosmic scale factor
The simplest way to solve these equations is by introducing a new quantity with the dimension of length,
a(t), called the cosmic scale factor, satisfying

a = H a.

and this shows that the mass, M = (4/3)πρ(t)a(t)3 , in an expanding sphere of radius a(t) is constant in
time. Eliminating H from (15.52), we obtain the following differential equation for cosmic scale factor,

metre.
From the particle analogy, we know that the scale factor will ‘escape’ to inﬁnity for E > 0, but turn
around and ‘fall back’ for E < 0. This means that the expansion will continue forever for ρ < ρc , but
eventually must turn around and become a contraction if ρ > ρc . The two types of universe are called open
or closed, respectively. For the critical case, ρ = ρc , the expansion also continues forever at the slowest

The problem is that the actual age of the universe determined from cosmology is model-dependent. If the
universe, for example, besides ordinary matter were ﬁlled with a ghostly ‘dark matter’ (or perhaps ‘dark

(15.62)

For sufﬁciently large ‘dark’ density, satisfying 2ρ0 > ρ, the gravitational attraction apparently turns into a
gravitational repulsion.
The real understanding of how a positive mass density ρ0 can give rise to an effective gravitational
repulsion can only be obtained from relativistic theory [78, p. 614], which correctly takes into account the
huge pressure accompanying ρ0 . Einstein already introduced in 1917 the so-called cosmological constant
(which is proportional to ρ0 ) for the explicit purpose of permitting static solutions to the cosmological
equations of general relativity. Clearly, the new cosmological equations admit a non-expanding, static
solution having ρ = 2ρ0 and H = 0. Since that time we have learned that our universe is not static
but instead expands with a ﬁnite Hubble constant. For many years the case for the cosmological constant
seemed to be closed, but recent discoveries may have changed that.
In an open universe, the following peculiar scenario is possible when ρ0 < 1/3ρc . For 2ρ0 < ρ <
ρc − ρ0 , the energy is positive and the effective gravity is attractive, so that the expansion will decelerate
˙
with time, i.e. with a = a( H + H 2 ) < 0. But sooner or later, the expansion will make the density fall below
¨
the critical value ρ = 2ρ0 , and the effective gravity becomes repulsive. The expansion will then begin to
accelerate with a > 0, and continue to do so forever thereafter. Recent observations seem to indicate that
¨
the cosmic expansion is in fact accelerating and that it may have been decelerating in the past5 .

The most important ﬂuids of our daily life, air and water, are lively and easily set into irregular motion.
Getting out of a bathtub creates visible turbulence in the soapy water, whereas we have to imagine the
unruly air behind us when we jog. Internal friction, or viscosity, seems to play only a minor role in these
ﬂuids. Other ﬂuids, like honey and grease, are highly viscous, do not easily become turbulent, and would
certainly be very hard to swim in.
Being lively or sluggish is, however, not an absolute property of a ﬂuid, but rather a condition of the
circumstances under which it ﬂows. Lava may be very sluggish in small amounts, but when it streams down
a mountainside it appears to be quite lively. We shall see later that there is a way of characterizing ﬂuid ﬂow
by means of a real number, called the Reynolds number, which is typically large for lively ﬂow and small
for sluggish ﬂow.
The earliest modern quantitative model of ﬂuid behaviour goes back to Euler about 250 years ago and
did not include viscosity. Although Newton introduced the concept, viscosity ﬁrst entered ﬂuid mechanics
in its modern formulation almost a century later. Fluids with no viscosity have been called ideal or perfect,
or even dry. An ideal ﬂuid does not hang on to solid surfaces but is able to slip along container walls with
ﬁnite velocity, whereas a real ﬂuid has to adjust its velocity ﬁeld so that it matches the surface speed of the
solid objects that are in contact with it.
Although truly ideal ﬂuids do not really exist, except for a component of superﬂuid helium close to zero
kelvin, viscous ﬂuids may nevertheless ﬂow with such high Reynolds number that they behave as nearly
ideal. Being ideal is thus more a property of the ﬂow conditions than of the ﬂuid itself. Independent of
how large the Reynolds number of the ﬂow, there will always be viscous boundary layers around solid
obstacles and near the walls of ﬂuid conduits. In this chapter we focus on nearly ideal ﬂow, and postpone
the introduction of viscosity to chapter 17 and of boundary layers to chapter 28.

16.1 The Euler equation
In 1755 Euler was the ﬁrst to write down Newton’s second law of motion for ﬂuids without viscosity. In
such a ﬂuid the only forces at play are pressure and gravity, but in distinction to hydrostatics, where these
two forces are in balance, they now give rise to a non-vanishing effective density of force f ∗ = ρ g − ∇ p.
Inserting this into the dynamic equation (15.35) and dividing by the density ρ, we obtain the Euler equation
for ideal ﬂuids,

16. NEARLY IDEAL FLOW
and a barotropic equation of state p = p(ρ), we have arrived at a closed set of ﬁve equations for the ﬁve
ﬁelds, vx , v y , vz , ρ and p (assuming that g is known). If the equation of state also depends on temperature,
p = p(ρ, T ), a heat equation for the temperature ﬁeld must be added to the set (see chapter 30).

Boundary conditions
Partial differential equations need boundary conditions. As in hydrostatics, Newton’s third law demands
that the pressure must be continuous across any material interface (in the absence of surface tension).
Furthermore, since moving ﬂuids are normally contained in tubes, pipes, or other kinds of conduits that are
impenetrable to the ﬂuid, it follows that the velocity component normal to a containing surface at rest must
vanish,
In an ideal ﬂuid the tangential
component of the velocity ﬁeld is
non-vanishing all the way to the
static boundary.

v · n = 0.

(16.3)

There are, however, no conditions on the tangential velocity in non-viscous ﬂow. Ideal ﬂuids are thus able
to slip along container surfaces with ﬁnite tangential velocity, whereas the omnipresent viscosity of real
ﬂuids also demands that the tangential velocity must vanish at a containing surface at rest.

Exploring the extremes
Although we are now in possession of the fundamental equations for ideal ﬂuids, solving them is another
matter. The bad news about nonlinear partial differential equations is that they are very hard to solve
and that makes it imperative to explore their usually simpler extreme limits. One such limit is the linear
approximation in which the nonlinearities are dropped, another is incompressible ﬂow in which the density
is taken to be a constant, and still another is steady ﬂow where all ﬁelds are assumed to be time-independent.
In the following sections these limits will be discussed in detail.
In a real ﬂuid the tangential component of the velocity ﬁeld rises
linearly from a static boundary
and joins smoothly with the ﬂow
at large.

16.2 Small-amplitude sound waves
When you clap your hands, you create momentarily a small disturbance in the air which propagates to
your ear and tells you that something happened. The diaphragm of the loudspeaker in your radio vibrates
in tune with the music carried by the radio waves and the electric currents in the radio and transfers its
vibrations to the air where they continue as sound. No signiﬁcant bulk movement of air takes place over
longer distances, but locally the air oscillates back and forth with small spatial amplitude, and the velocity,
density and pressure ﬁelds oscillate along with it.

Wave equation
For simplicity we assume that there is no gravity (see however problem 16.17). Before the sound starts, the
ﬂuid is assumed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium with constant density ρ0 and constant pressure p0 . We now
disturb the equilibrium by setting the ﬂuid into motion with a tiny velocity ﬁeld v(x, t). The disturbance
generates a small change in the density, ρ = ρ0 + ρ, and in the pressure p = p0 + p. Inserting this into
the Euler equations we obtain to ﬁrst order in the small quantities, v, p, and ρ,

5500 km h−1 .

Isentropic sound speed in an ideal gas
Sound vibrations in air are normally so rapid that temperature equilibrium is never established, allowing
us to assume that the oscillations take place without heat conduction, i.e. adiabatically. The bulk modulus
(4.38) of an isentropic ideal gas is K 0 = γ p0 where γ is the adiabatic index, and we obtain

29 g mol−1 , this comes to c0 ≈ 343 m s−1 ≈ 1235 km h−1 . Since the temperature of the homentropic
atmosphere falls linearly with height according to (4.43), the speed of sound varies with height z above
the ground as

where c0 is the sound speed at sea level and h 2 ≈ 30 km is the homentropic scale height (4.44). At the
ﬂying altitude of modern jet aircraft, z ≈ 10 km, the sound speed has dropped to c ≈ 280 m s−1 ≈
1000 km h−1 . At greater heights this expression begins to fail because the homentropic model of the
atmosphere fails.

Plane wave solution

¹x

An elementary plane pressure wave moving along the x-axis with wavelength λ, period τ and amplitude
p1 > 0 is described by a pressure correction of the form,
p = p1 cos(kx − ωt),

(16.11)

where k = 2π/λ is the wavenumber and ω = 2π/τ is the circular frequency. Inserting the plane wave into
2
the wave equation (16.7), we obtain ω2 = c0 k 2 or c0 = ω/k = λ/τ . The surfaces of constant pressure are
planes orthogonal to the direction of propagation, satisfying kx − ωt = const. Differentiating this equation
with respect to time, we see that the planes of constant pressure move with velocity d x/dt = ω/k = c0 ,
also called the phase velocity of the wave. This shows that c0 given by (16.8) may indeed be identiﬁed with
the speed of sound in the material.

Validity of the approximation
It only remains to check whether the approximation of disregarding the nonlinear terms is valid. The actual
ratio between the magnitudes of the advective and local accelerations is,
kv 2
|(v · ∇)v|
v
≈ 1 = 1.
|∂v/∂ t|

(16.13)

The condition for the approximation is thus that the amplitude of the velocity oscillations should be much
smaller than the speed of sound, v1
c0 , or equivalently that p1
K 0 or a1
λ/2π .
Example 16.2.2 (Loudspeaker):
A certain loudspeaker transmits sound to air at a frequency
ω/2π = 1000 Hz with diaphragm displacement amplitude of a1 = 1 mm. The velocity amplitude
becomes v1 = a1 ω ≈ 6 m s−1 , and since v1 /c0 ≈ 1/57 the approximation of leaving out the advective
acceleration is well justiﬁed.

16.3 Steady incompressible ﬂow
In many practical uses of ﬂuids, the ﬂow does not change with time, and is said to be steady or stationary.
In this section we shall for simplicity also assume that the ﬂuid is incompressible with constant density.
Steady ﬂow in compressible ﬂuids will be analysed in section 16.4 where we shall learn that a ﬂuid in
steady ﬂow is effectively incompressible when the ﬂow velocity is everywhere much smaller than the speed
of sound.
Taking ∂v/∂ t = 0 and ρ = ρ0 in Eulers equations we now ﬁnd,

pointed out the relation between
pressure and velocity in the
world’s ﬁrst book on hydrodynamics, Hydrodynamica, which
he published in 1738. Actually
it was not Bernoulli who formulated the quantitative theorem
which now bears his name, but
rather Lagrange in his famous
book on analytic mechanics from
1788 [70].

(16.14)

Truly steady ﬂow is like true incompressibility an idealization, only valid to a certain approximation. A
river may ﬂow steadily for days and weeks, while over several months seasonal changes in rainfall makes
its water level rise and subside again. If one empties a cistern ﬁlled with water through a narrow pipe, the
ﬂow is almost steady in the pipe for a time, except that the level of water in the cistern slowly goes down
and thereby reduces the ﬂow speed in the pipe. In such cases, the ﬂow should rather be called nearly steady
or quasi-stationary.

How steady ﬂow is reached: This explanation begs the question of how a steady ﬂow is ever
established, for example in a calm river downstream from a waterfall. Since all ﬂows start out being
time-dependent, viscosity must be capable of removing the surplus energy from a lively ﬂow to calm
it down, but even when we include it (in chapter 17) there is no guarantee that the ﬂow will become
steady after a long time. You just have to open the water faucet wide and watch the persistent
turbulent splashing in the kitchen sink to realize that steady ﬂow may not always be the result of
steady or even static conditions.

Bernoulli’s theorem for incompressible ﬂuid
The negative sign of the pressure gradient in Euler’s steady-ﬂow equation shows that in the absence of
gravity a ﬂow accelerating in a certain direction must be accompanied by a drop in pressure in the same
direction. Regions of high ﬂow velocity must generally have a lower pressure than regions of low velocity.
Bernoulli’s theorem makes this qualitative conclusion quantitative.
For an incompressible ﬂuid with constant density ρ = ρ0 , Bernoulli’s theorem (to be proved below)
states that the ﬁeld,
1

is constant along streamlines. In the absence of gravity , the constancy of the Bernoulli ﬁeld H implies
as we foresaw that an increase in velocity along a streamline must be compensated by a similar decrease
in pressure, and conversely. The Bernoulli ﬁeld may be viewed as an extension of the effective potential

(4.21) to ﬂuid in motion. Note that the ﬁrst two terms in the Bernoulli ﬁeld make up the total mechanical
(i.e. kinetic plus potential) energy of a unit mass particle, also called the speciﬁc mechanical energy. We
shall later discuss how the Bernoulli ﬁeld is related to energy (section 22.9).
The proof of the theorem is straightforward. The material rate of change of H along a particle orbit is
given by the material derivative (15.29), and since all ﬁelds are time-independent in steady ﬂow we get

The importance of Bernoulli’s theorem for many practical hydrodynamical applications has led to several
different terminologies. Since ρ0 H has the dimension of pressure, the term (1/2)ρ0 v 2 is often called the
dynamic pressure as opposed to the static pressure p. The combination p + ρ0 is called the effective
pressure. A point where the ﬂuid has zero velocity, v = 0, is called a stagnation point for the ﬂow. In the
absence of gravity, the pressure at a stagnation point is p0 = ρ0 H , also called the stagnation pressure.
An often encountered engineering terminology is used in constant gravity, g = (0, 0, −g0 ), where the
Bernoulli ﬁeld in ﬂat-Earth coordinates becomes,
H=

p
1 2
.
v + g0 z +
2
ρ0

(16.16)

The vertical height z of a point on the streamline above some ﬁxed reference level z = 0 is called the
static head. Similarly p/ρ0 g0 is called the pressure head, and v 2 /2g0 is called the velocity head. The
total head, H/g0 , is the sum of these three terms, and is by Bernoulli’s theorem the same everywhere along
a streamline.

Uses of Bernoulli’s theorem
Bernoulli’s theorem is highly useful because most of the ﬂows that we deal with in our daily lives are nearly
ideal and nearly incompressible. Bernoulli’s theorem often provides us with a ﬁrst idea about the behaviour
of a ﬂow in a given geometry. The drop in pressure accompanying an increase in ﬂow velocity lies, for
example, at the root of lift generation for both animals and machines, whether they swim or ﬂy.
Example 16.3.1 (Life of a ﬂatﬁsh): Lift is usually thought of as beneﬁcial, but that may not always
be the case. Some ﬁsh hide by burrowing superﬁcially into the sandy bottom of a stream. The ﬁsh’s
curved upper surface forces the passing water to speed up, leading to a pressure drop above the ﬁsh that
grows with the square of the ﬂow velocity. If the stream velocity increases, the ﬁsh may be lifted out of
the sand, whether it wants to or not. To avoid that may be why ﬂatﬁsh are indeed—ﬂat. We shall return
to this example and calculate the lift on a half-buried spherical ﬁsh in example 16.9.1.
In many cases of practical interest (see, for example [24, 80]), ﬂuids stream through a network of
ducts with inlets and outlets that are controlled externally. Assuming that there are well-deﬁned streamlines
connecting inlets with outlets, Bernoulli’s theorem is typically used to relate the velocities and pressures at
inlets and outlets, even if nothing is known about details of the the internal ﬂow in the system. Viscosity is,
however, never completely absent, but is mostly negligible well away from the boundaries and containers
that we use to handle ﬂuids. Exploiting the constancy of H along a streamline is always an approximation,
and in any realistic problem there will be what the engineers call ‘head loss’ due to viscosity, to secondary
ﬂow, and to turbulence generated by surface irregularities.

by Bernoulli’s theorem, there will
be a lower pressure above the

Typically it is also assumed that the ﬂow velocity U is the same all over the duct cross-section A . Such
a pattern is called plug ﬂow and the volume ﬂux in the duct is simply Q = AU . It is by no means guaranteed
to be correct, and engineers often put in a discharge factor C to take care of the lower velocities at the sides
of a duct, writing Q = C AU where U is now the velocity of a central streamline (see problem 16.7).

The wine emerges with the same

A simple duct with slowly varying cross section carries a constant volume ﬂux Q of incompressible ﬂuid.
For simplicity we assume the duct is horizontal, such that gravity can be disregarded. Taking a streamline
running horizontally through the duct, we obtain from Bernoulli’s theorem that,

(16.18)

This demonstrates the Venturi effect: the pressure falls when the duct cross section decreases, and rises
when it increases.

Torricelli’s Law
Consider a barrel of wine with a little spout close to the bottom. If the plug in the spout is suddenly
removed, the pressure causes the wine to stream out with a considerable speed. Provided the spout is
narrow compared to the size of the barrel, a nearly steady ﬂow will soon establish itself. This is a case
where Bernoulli’s theorem readily yields an expression for the velocity of the outﬂow.
Consider a streamline starting near the top of the barrel and running with the ﬂow down through the
middle of the spout. Near the top at a height z = h over the position of the spout, the ﬂuid is almost at rest,
i.e. v ≈ 0. The pressure is atmospheric, p = p0 , and the gravitational potential may be taken to be g0 h so
that

Just outside the spout the ﬂuid has some horizontal velocity v , and the pressure is also atmospheric, p = p0 ,

which has the solution

(16.21)

Surprisingly, this is exactly the same velocity as a drop of wine would have obtained by falling freely from
the top of the barrel to the spout. This result is called Torricelli’s Law (1644), and preceding Bernoulli’s
theorem by more than a century it was in its time a major step forward in the understanding of ﬂuid
mechanics. We could, in fact, have come to the same conclusion simply by converting the potential energy
of a water particle into kinetic energy.
In a sense the barrel acts as a device for diverting the vertical momentum of the falling liquid into the
horizontal direction (see chapter 22). All streamlines yield the same result, as long as we avoid choosing
a streamline running very near to the walls of the barrel and spout, where the unavoidable viscosity slows
down the ﬂow in the boundary layers. Even if the spout is replaced by a pipe that is not even horizontal but

may turn and twist, the exit velocity at the exit of the pipe will equal the free-fall velocity from the ﬂuid
surface at the top of the barrel.
Example 16.3.2 (Wine barrel): A large cylindrical wine barrel has diameter 1 m and height 2 m.
According to Torricelli’s law the wine will emerge from the spout with the free-fall speed of about
6.3 m s−1 . If the spout opening has diameter 5 cm, about 12.3 litres of wine will be spilled on the ﬂoor
per second. At this rate it would take 2 min to empty the barrel, but we shall see below that it actually
takes double because the level sinks.

Quasi-stationary emptying of a wine barrel
If the barrel has constant cross-section A 0 , Leonardo’s law (15.17) tells us that the average vertical ﬂow
A 0 is the cross section of the spout and v = 2g0 z
velocity in the barrel is v0 = v A/A 0 where A
the average horizontal ﬂow velocity through the spout when the water level is z. Since dz/dt = −v0 , we
obtain the following differential equation for quasi-stationary emptying of the barrel,

This time equals the free-fall time from height h multiplied by the usually huge ratio of the barrel and spout
cross sections. For the cylindrical wine barrel of example 16.3.2 the freefall time is 0.64 s and it takes 400
times longer, about 4 min, to empty the barrel.

The Pitot tube
Fast aircraft often have a sharply pointed nose which on closer inspection is seen to end in a little open tube.
On other aircraft the tube may stick orthogonally out from the side and is bent forward into the oncoming
airstream. This device is called a Pitot tube, and is used in many variants to measure ﬂow speeds in gases
and liquids. In its simplest and original form, the Pitot tube is just an open glass tube bent through a right
angle. The tube is lowered into a river streaming steadily with velocity U , with one end turned horizontally
towards the current and the other vertically in the air above. The ﬂow will stem water up into the vertical
part of the tube, until the hydrostatic pressure of the water column balances the dynamic pressure from the
ﬂow. After the ﬂow has steadied, the water in the tube rises to a height h above the river surface.
In the steady state the water speed must vanish at the entrance to the horizontal part of the tube, and
a horizontal streamline arriving here from afar must come to an end in a so-called stagnation point. The
gravitational potential is constant everywhere along the horizontal streamline, and can be disregarded, so
that Bernoulli’s theorem for this streamline reads,
1
p

,
ρ0

ρ0

(16.24)

where p is the pressure at inﬁnity, and p0 is the stagnation pressure. The excess stagnation pressure
p = p0 − p = (1/2)ρ0 U 2 must also equal the extra hydrostatic pressure from the water column above
the water surface, p = ρ0 g0 h, so that
U=

2g0 h.

(16.25)

Again we ﬁnd the simple and surprising result that the speed of the water is exactly the same as it would be
after a free-fall from the height h. At a typical ﬂow speed of 1 m s−1 the water in the tube is raised 5 cm
above the river level.

Farmer’s wisdom: Farmers know better than to leave the barn door open towards the wind in
a storm, even if they do not know Bernoulli’s theorem. A gust of wind will not only decrease the
pressure above the barn roof because the wind has to move faster above the roof than at the ground,
but the Pitot effect will also increase the pressure inside, giving the roof a double reason to blow off.

no acceptable real solutions to (16.26) in the interval 0.32 < Frin < 1.69.
Example 16.3.3 (Water scoop): Forest ﬁres are sometimes combated by aircraft dropping large
amounts of sea or lake water. To avoid landing and take-off, the aircraft collects water by lowering
a scoop into the water while ﬂying slowly at very low altitude. If the scoop turns directly forward and
the aircraft velocity is U , it can like the Pitot tube raise the water to a maximal height, h = U 2 /2g0 .
Even for a speed as low as U = 120 km h−1 ≈ 33 m s−1 , this comes to h = 55 m. In practice, the
height of the water tank over the lake surface is much smaller, so that the water should ideally arrive
in the tank with nearly maximal speed U . A scoop with an opening area of just A ≈ 300 cm2 can
deliver water at a rate of Q = U A ≈ 1 m3 s−1 . Turbulence lowers this somewhat, but typically such
an aircraft can collect 6 m3 in just 12 s.

∗ Shallow river with slowly changing bed

¹x

Does a rise in the river bed z =
b(x) generate a drop or a rise in
the height of the surface?

The surface of a shallow river ﬂowing steadily along reﬂects the underlying structure of the river bed, as
everybody has probably noted. It is, however, not so clear how the level of the water surface and the
average water speed react to a change in the shape of the river bed. Will these quantities rise or fall when
the otherwise horizontal river bed, for example, rises gently?
For simplicity we model the river as a very wide, essentially two-dimensional stream along x in
which the bottom height z = b(x) depends only on x. The depth is assumed to vary so slowly that its
1. In that case the ﬂow will be dominated by the x-component of the
derivative is small, b (x)
|vz |, and it may be reasonable to assume that the river carries a plug ﬂow characterized
velocity, |vx |
by vx = U (x), independent of y and z. Denoting the local depth by d(x), the height of the open surface
is h(x) = b(x) + d(x). Mass conservation together with Bernoulli’s theorem applied to a streamline along
the surface (where the pressure is constant) imply that,
Q = U (x)d(x),

(16.26a)

H = 1 U (x)2 + g0 (b(x) + d(x)),

(16.26b)

are both independent of x. In principle these two equations can be solved for U (x) and d(x) in terms of
b(x). Unfortunately the resulting third degree polynomial equation has a rather messy solution.
As usual it is easier to understand the local structure. Differentiating both equations with respect to x

In chapter 24 we shall see that g0 d is the velocity of shallow-water surface waves. Intuitively one would
expect something dramatic to happen when the ﬂow velocity passes through the shallow wave speed,
because this is akin to passing through the speed of sound in the atmosphere. Eliminating the velocity
in favour of the Froude number we obtain the differential equations,

(16.30)

The behaviour of the river depends crucially on whether the local Froude number is smaller or greater than
the critical value Fr = 1.
A soft step in the river bed with b (x) > 0 causes the depth to decrease, d < 0, if the incoming Froude
number before the step is smaller than unity, Frin < 1, and conversely the depth will increase if Frin > 1.
The water surface height, h = b + d , follows the same pattern. The local Froude number will itself in both
cases come closer to the nonphysical singular value Fr = 1. Whether this value is actually reached depends
on the height of the step and the incoming Froude number. There will, for a given step height, always be
an interval of incoming Froude numbers, Fr1 < Frin < Fr2 with Fr1 < 1 and Fr2 > 1 in which the simple
model presented here breaks down and no acceptable solution can be found.
Physically, the smooth water surface will break and froth at the step in the forbidden Froude number
interval. For allowed values outside the forbidden interval the local Froude number must stay on the same
side of the singularity everywhere along the step. A smooth crossing through Fr = 1 can only take place at
a point where b (x) = 0, i.e. at a soft bump in the river bed.
Example 16.3.4 (Shallow river): In ﬁgure 16.1 a river of initial depth din = 1 m passes a soft step
of height bout − bin = 0.3 m. The forbidden incoming Froude number interval is 0.32 < Frin < 1.69,
corresponding to a forbidden incoming velocity interval 1.0 m s−1 < Uin < 5.3 m s−1 . The allowed
changes in the height of the water surface lie in the intervals −8 cm < h out − h in < 0 for Frin < Fr1
and 30 cm < h out − h in < 72 cm for Frin > Fr2 .

Effective incompressibility
First we shall demonstrate the claim made in the preceding section that in steady ﬂow a ﬂuid is effectively
incompressible when the ﬂow speed is everywhere much smaller than the local speed of sound. The ratio
of the local ﬂow speed v (relative to a static solid object or boundary wall) and the local sound speed c is
called the (local) Mach number,
|v|
(16.32)
Ma =

c

Ernst Mach (1838–1916). Austrian positivist philosopher and
physicist. Made early advances
in psycho-physics, the physics of
sensations. His rejection of Newton’s absolute space and time
prepared the way for Einstein’s
theory of relativity. Proposed the
principle that inertia results from
the interaction between a body
and all other matter in the universe.

In terms of the Mach number, the claim is that a steady ﬂow is effectively incompressible when Ma
1
everywhere. Conversely, the ﬂow is truly compressible if the local Mach number somewhere is comparable
to unity or larger, Ma 1.
The essential step in the proof is to relate the gradient of pressure to the gradient of density, ∇ p =
√
(d p/dρ)∇ρ = c2 ∇ρ , where c = d p/dρ is the local speed of sound. Writing the divergence condition in
the form ∇ · (ρv) = ρ∇ · v + (v · ∇)ρ = 0 and making use of the Euler equation without gravity, we ﬁnd
the exact result,

∇ · v = − (v · ∇)ρ = − 2 (v · ∇) p =

Applying the Schwarz inequality to the numerator (see problem 16.16) we get
|v|2
|∇v| = Ma2 |∇v| ,

c2
where |∇v| is the norm (2.17) of the velocity gradient matrix. This relation clearly demonstrates that for
1 the divergence is much smaller than the local velocity gradients, making the incompressibility

condition, ∇ · v = 0, a good approximation. Typically, a ﬂow will be taken to be incompressible when
Ma 0.3 everywhere so that Ma2 0.1. In the remainder of this section we assume that this condition is
not fulﬁlled (everywhere).
|∇ · v| ≤

Example 16.4.1 (Mach numbers): Waving your hands in the air, you generate ﬂow velocities at
most of the order of metres per second, corresponding to Ma ≈ 0.01. Driving a car at 120 km h−1 ≈
33 m s−1 corresponds to Ma ≈ 0.12. A passenger jet ﬂying at a height of 10 km with velocity about
900 km h−1 ≈ 250 m s−1 has Ma ≈ 0.9 because the velocity of sound is only about 1000 km h−1
at this height (see example 16.2.1). Even if this speed is subsonic, considerable compression of the
air must occur especially at the front of the wings and body of the aircraft. The Concorde and modern
ﬁghter aircraft operate at supersonic speeds at Mach 2–3, and the Space Shuttle enters the atmosphere at
the hypersonic speed of Mach 25. The strong compression of the air at the frontal parts of such aircraft
create shock waves that appear to us as a sonic boom (see chapter 25).

Bernoulli’s theorem for barotropic ﬂuids
For compressible ﬂuids, Bernoulli’s theorem is still valid in a slightly modiﬁed form. If the ﬂuid is in a
barotropic state with ρ = ρ( p), the Bernoulli ﬁeld becomes,
H = 1 v2 +

+ w( p),

where
w( p) =

elementary and follows the same lines as before, using Dw/Dt = (dw/d p)Dp/Dt = (1/ρ)(v · ∇) p.
The most interesting barotropic ﬂuid is an ideal gas with adiabatic index γ , for which it has been shown
on page 55 that

Thus, in the absence of gravity, a drop in velocity along a streamline in isentropic ﬂow is accompanied by
a rise in temperature (as well as a rise in pressure and density).

16.4. STEADY COMPRESSIBLE FLOW

215

Isentropic steady ﬂow: There is a conceptual subtlety in understanding isentropic steady ﬂow
because of the unavoidable heat conduction that takes place in all real ﬂuids. Since truly steady ﬂow
lasts ‘forever’, one might think that there would be ample time for a local temperature change to
spread throughout the ﬂuid, regardless of how badly it conducts heat. But remember that steady ﬂow
is not static, and fresh ﬂuid is being compressed or expanded adiabatically all the time. So, provided
the ﬂow is sufﬁciently fast, heat conduction will have little effect. The physics of heat and ﬂow is
discussed in chapter 30.

Stagnation point temperature rise in an ideal gas
An object moving through a ﬂuid has at least one stagnation point at the front where the ﬂuid is at rest
relative to the object. There is also at least one stagnation point at the rear of a body, but vortex formation
and turbulence will generally disturb the ﬂow so much in this region that the streamlines get tangled and we
cannot use Bernoulli’s theorem to relate velocity and pressure at the rear of the body.
At the forward stagnation point the gas is compressed and the temperature will always be higher than
in the ﬂuid at large (and similarly at the rear stagnation point if it exists). In the frame of reference where
the object is at rest and the ﬂuid asymptotically moves with constant speed U and temperature T , the ﬂow
is steady, and we ﬁnd from (16.35) and (16.37) in the absence of gravity,
1U2 + c T = c T ,

where T0 is the stagnation point temperature. Accordingly the temperature rise due to adiabatic compression
becomes,

(16.38)

Note that the stagnation temperature rise depends only on the velocity difference between the body and the
ﬂuid far from the body, and not on the pressure or density of the gas.
Example 16.4.2: Taking γ = 7/5 we obtain for a car moving at 100 km h−1 a stagnation point
temperature rise of merely 0.4 K. At the front of a passenger jet travelling at 900 km h−1 the stagnation
point rises a moderate 31 K, whereas a supersonic aircraft travelling at 2300 km h−1 suffers a stagnation
point temperature rise of about 200 K. When a re-entry vehicle hits the dense atmosphere with a speed of
3 km s−1 the stagnation point temperature rise becomes nearly 4500 K. At full orbital speed, 8 km s−1 ,
the stagnation point temperature would formally become 32 000 K, but the density of the air in the outer
reaches of the atmosphere is so small that the continuum assumption breaks down.
Whether the tip of a moving object actually attains the stagnation point temperature depends primarily on
how efﬁciently heat is conducted away from this region by the material of the object. The moving object is
usually solid with a vastly greater heat capacity than the air near the stagnation point. In addition to adiabatic
compression viscous friction also produces heat, and for extreme aircraft such as the Space Shuttle it has
been necessary to use special ceramic materials to withstand temperatures that are otherwise capable of
melting and burning metals. Freely falling meteors appear as shooting stars in the sky, mainly because of
viscous friction.

Stagnation point properties
It is often convenient to express the ratio of the stagnation point temperature and the local temperature in
√
terms of the local Mach number Ma = |v| /c where c = γ RT/Mmol is the local sound velocity. From
(16.38) we obtain
T0
1
= 1 + (γ − 1)Ma2 .
T
2

(16.39)

Even if the streamline does not actually end in a stagnation point, T0 will be a constant for the streamline
because it represents the value of the Bernoulli function, H = c p T0 , which is constant along the streamline.
The stagnation temperature may be thought of as the temperature that would be obtained if a tiny object
were inserted into the ﬂow far downstream of the observation point.

The collection of sonic points typically form a sonic surface, for example in the duct ﬂow to be discussed
below. The sonic point temperature may be calculated from the stagnation point temperature (16.39) by
setting Ma = 1,

For γ = 7/5, the ratio is T1 /T0 = 5/6. Multiplying (16.39) by T1 /T0 and rearranging the expression, we

The sonic temperature T1 is, like the stagnation temperature T0 , a constant for any streamline, independent
of whether the ﬂow actually becomes sonic on this streamline. The sonic density ρ1 and pressure p1 may
similarly be obtained from stagnation values and related to the local Mach number by relations like (16.40).

Ideal gas ﬂow in duct with slowly varying cross section
Consider now an ideal gas ﬂowing through a duct with a slowly varying cross section such that the
temperature T , density ρ, pressure p and normal velocity U may be assumed to be constant over any
given (but otherwise arbitrary) planar duct cross section of area A. We are interested in determining the
conditions under which the ﬂow may become sonic in the duct.

This function is shown (for γ = 7/5) as the solid curve in ﬁg. 16.2 together with the corresponding
temperature, density, pressure and velocity ratios.
The main observation to make from ﬁg. 16.2 is that the local area A has a minimum at Ma = 1. This
shows that it is only possible to make a smooth transition from subsonic to supersonic ﬂow by sending the
gas through a constriction in which the duct ﬁrst converges and then diverges, forming a throat at the point
where its area is minimal. If the ﬂow parameters are set up such that the sonic area A 1 precisely equals
the physical area A throat of the throat, the subsonic ﬂow entering the converging part of the duct will travel
down the left-hand branch of the fully drawn curve in ﬁg. 16.2, increasing in velocity until the Mach number
reaches unity exactly at the throat. Having passed the throat, the ﬂow is now supersonic and travels up the
right-hand branch of the fully drawn curve while increasing in velocity further in the diverging part of the
constriction.
The sonic point is not always reached. After all, ﬂutes and other musical instruments, including our
voices, have constrictions in the airﬂow that do not give rise to supersonic ﬂow (which would surely destroy
the music). If the physical throat area is larger than the sonic area, A throat > A 1 , the Mach number does
not reach unity at the throat. The maximal Mach number at the throat, Mathroat , is determined from (16.44)
by setting A = A throat . Graphically, it may be read off from the left-hand branch of the solid curve in
ﬁgure 16.2 at the point it crosses through A throat /A 1 . In ﬁgure 16.3 this is illustrated in a simple model.
Suppose now that the duct is carrying a subsonic ﬂow through the throat with A throat > A 1 , and that
we begin to throttle the ﬂow by diminishing the throat area A throat without changing the ﬂow parameters
at the entry. Since the sonic area A 1 is determined by the entry values, it will not change, so the throttling
may continue until A throat = A 1 . At this point the ﬂow becomes sonic at the throat. If we now continue
throttling, the entry parameters are at least forced to change in such a way that the the sonic area follows the
diminishing throat area, A 1 = A throat , and the ﬂow stays sonic at the throat. A duct with a throat operating

16.5 Vorticity
The value of the Bernoulli ﬁeld H (x) at a point x is only a function of the streamline going through this
point. Different streamlines will in general have different values of H . This can be illustrated by considering
the case of Newton’s rotating bucket which was discussed before on page 87.

The constancy of the pressure on the open surface determines its parabolic shape z = 2 r 2 /2g0 + const.
In the non-rotating (laboratory) system, there is no centrifugal force, but the ﬂuid moves steadily with
velocity v = r , and the streamlines are concentric circles. The Bernoulli ﬁeld becomes in this system,
H (r ) =

(16.47)

where in the last step we have made use of (16.45) to eliminate the pressure. The Bernoulli function depends
in this case on the radial distance from the axis, but is of course constant on the circular streamlines as
Bernoulli’s theorem assures us. H is evidently independent of z, and we shall see below that this also
follows from general rules.

Asymptotically uniform ﬂow
It is often possible to relate the values of H for different streamlines. A general and frequently occurring
example is a body moving with constant velocity through a ﬂuid otherwise at rest, were it not for the
disturbance created by the body. The relativity of motion in Newtonian mechanics tells us that this unsteady
ﬂow is physically equivalent to a steady ﬂow around a stationary body in a ﬂuid which, far away from the
body, moves with constant velocity under constant pressure. We tacitly used this equivalence before in
example 16.3.3 on page 212.
At great distances from the body the ﬂow will have the same velocity U, and in hydrostatic balance in
the rest system it will also have a constant value of the effective pressure P ∗ = p + ρ0 . Consequently,
the Bernoulli ﬁeld must take the same value
H0 =

1 2
P∗
U +
2
ρ0

(16.48)

for all streamlines coming in from afar. Thus, if one can be sure that all streamlines around the body
originate inﬁnitely far away, then H must take the same value over all space, i.e. H (x) = H0 .

16.5. VORTICITY

219

The vorticity ﬁeld
The simple result that H is spatially constant for asymptotically uniform ﬂow is spoilt by the possibility that
there may be streamlines forming closed curves unconnected with the ﬂow at inﬁnity. This was the case for
Newton’s bucket in the non-rotating coordinate system where the streamlines were concentric circles, but
common experience indicates that such circulating ﬂow may occur in the wake of the disturbance created
by the shape of a container or a moving body. We are thus naturally led to the study of local circulation in
a ﬂuid, and we shall see that H is in fact globally constant if there is no local circulation anywhere.
Using the Euler equation for steady incompressible non-viscous ﬂow (16.14), the gradient of the
Bernoulli ﬁeld becomes,
∇i H =

1
∇i v 2 + ∇i
2

+

1
∇i p = v · ∇i v − v · ∇vi = (v × (∇ × v))i .
ρ0

This result, which is also valid for non-viscous, barotropic, compressible ﬂow, allows us to write
∇ H = v × ω,

(16.49)

where we have deﬁned a new ﬁeld, the vorticity ﬁeld, which is simply the curl of the velocity ﬁeld
ω = ∇ × v.

(16.50)

The vorticity ﬁeld also goes back to Cauchy (1841) and is a quantitative measure of the local circulation in
the ﬂuid. In any region where the vorticity ﬁeld vanishes completely, we have ∇ H = 0, so the Bernoulli
ﬁeld must take one value only in that region, i.e. H (x) = H0 . Flow completely free of vorticity is called
irrotational ﬂow and leads to a particularly simple formalism which we shall present in section 16.7.
Example 16.5.1: The curl of the ﬁeld v = (x 2 , 2x y, 0) is ω = (0, 0, 2y). The curl of v = (y 2 , 2x y, 0)
vanishes, so this velocity ﬁeld is irrotational.

Ê

Vorticity and local rotation
A trivial example of a ﬂow with vorticity is a steadily rotating rigid body, for example Newton’s bucket in
the laboratory system. If the rotation vector of the body is , the velocity ﬁeld becomes v = × x, and
the vorticity
∇ × ( × x) =

(∇ · x) − (

· ∇)x = 3 −

=2 .

(16.51)

The vorticity is in this case constant and equal to twice the rotation vector.
The factor of 2 seems a bit strange but is a general result which may be veriﬁed by calculating the
gradient of H for Newton’s bucket. We ﬁnd using (16.49)
∇H = (

× x) × 2

Together these results imply that the Bernoulli ﬁeld is constant on the two-dimensional surfaces formed
by combining vortex lines and streamlines, sometimes called Lamb surfaces, and sometimes Bernoulli
surfaces. Since streamlines for circulating ﬂuids tend to form closed curves, these surfaces will usually be
long tubes, called vortex tubes. For Newton’s bucket the vortex tubes are cylinders concentric with the axis
of rotation, and this explains why the Bernoulli ﬁeld cannot depend on z, as we noted earlier.

The vorticity ﬁeld is derived from the velocity ﬁeld, so the equation of motion for the vorticity ﬁeld must
follow from the equation of motion for the velocity ﬁeld, (16.1). Eliminating the pressure by means of
the Bernoulli ﬁeld (16.15) and retracing the steps leading to (16.49), the Euler equation for a non-viscous
incompressible ﬂuid may be written,
1
∂v
∇ p + g = v × ω − ∇ H.
= −(v · ∇)v −
∂t

The ﬁnal result is also valid for any non-viscous compressible barotropic ﬂuid. For steady ﬂow where
∂v/∂t = 0, we recover of course (16.49). The equation of motion for vorticity is obtained by taking the
curl of both sides of this equation, and using that the curl of a gradient vanishes,

∂ω

(16.55)

There is a major lesson to draw from this equation. If the vorticity vanishes identically, ω(x, t) = 0,
throughout a region V of space at an instant of time t, then we have ∂ω/∂t = 0 for all x in V at t. Thus,
the vorticity ﬁeld will not change in the next instant, and continuing this argument, we conclude that if the
vorticity ﬁeld vanishes in the volume V at time t, it will vanish in this volume forever after.
In other words: in the absence of viscosity, vorticity cannot be generated by the ﬂow of a non-viscous
ﬂuid but must be present from the outset. Thus, if you accelerate a body from rest in a truly ideal ﬂuid, the
ﬂow will remain without vorticity, because ω = 0 at the beginning. The whirling air that trails a speeding
car or an airplane must for this reason somehow be caused by viscous forces, independent of how tiny the
viscosity is.

16.6 Circulation
Vorticity is a local property of a ﬂuid, indicating how much the ﬂuid rotates in the neighbourhood of a
point. The corresponding global concept is called circulation and is formally deﬁned to be the integrated
projection of the velocity ﬁeld on the line elements of a closed curve C,
(C, t) =

C

v(x, t) · d .

(16.56)

If C encircles a region of whirling ﬂuid, the projection of the velocity ﬁeld onto the curve will tend to be
of the same sign all the way around. Whether it is positive or negative depends on whether the curve runs
with the whirling ﬂow or against it. We emphasize that the circulation may be calculated for any curve, not
just a streamline encircling a whirl, although that might be the natural thing to do in some situations.

Stokes’ theorem
The most important theorem about circulation is due to Stokes. It is completely general and states that the
circulation of the velocity ﬁeld around a closed curve is equal to the ﬂux of the vorticity through any surface
bounded by the curve,

16.6. CIRCULATION

221

It does not matter which surface S the ﬂux is calculated for, as long as it has C as the boundary, lies entirely
within the ﬂuid, and is oriented consistently with the orientation of C. Stokes’ theorem is like Gauss’
theorem (6.4) valid for any vector ﬁeld. The vorticity ﬁeld ω = ∇ × v is thus a measure of local circulation
in the ﬂuid.
Example 16.6.1 (Solid rotation): A ﬂuid rotates steadily like a solid body with velocity v = r .
In the non-rotating ‘laboratory’ system the circulation around a circle (which is also a streamline) with
radius r is obtained by multiplying the constant velocity with the circumference of the circle,
(r ) = 2πr

r = 2π r 2 = 2

The last expression conﬁrms Stokes’ theorem because the circulation is the product of the constant
vorticity 2 of a solid rotation body and the area of the circle.

Proof of Stokes’ theorem: As before the relation between global and local quantities is established
by calculating the global quantity for an inﬁnitesimal geometric ﬁgure, in this case a tiny rectangle in the
x y-plane with sides a and b. To ﬁrst order in the sides we ﬁnd the circulation (suppressing z and t)

The last expression is indeed the projection (∇ × v) · d S of the vorticity ﬁeld on the small vector surface
element of the rectangle, d S = (0, 0, ab).
Consider now a not necessarily planar open surface built up from little rectangles of this kind. Adding
together the circulation for each rectangle, the contributions from the inner common edges cancel and one
is left only with the circulation around the outer perimeter of the surface, which is Stokes theorem. The
proof also implies that the shape of the surface S does not matter (see problem 16.9).

∗ Kelvin’s circulation theorem
Kelvin’s famous circulation theorem from 1868 states that in a non-viscous ﬂuid the circulation around a
closed comoving curve is independent of time. In other words, if C(t) is a comoving closed curve, then
D
d (C(t), t)
≡
= 0.
Dt
dt

(16.59)

A comoving closed curve is washed along with the ﬂuid and may thus change shape dramatically without
a change in its circulation. In steady ﬂow the circulation around any ﬁxed closed curve is independent of
time, but the theorem concerns a curve following the material of the ﬂuid whether the motion is steady or
not.
Kelvin’s theorem applies only to ideal or nearly ideal ﬂow. In a viscous ﬂuid the circulation will change
at a rate proportional to the viscosity, and viscosity will act both as dissipator and generator of vorticity. It
is as mentioned before impossible to generate vorticity—or to get rid of it—without the aid of viscosity.

Proof of Kelvin’s theorem: The proof of the theorem is straightforward. We shall carry it through for
an incompressible ﬂuid, but the proof is easily extended to a barotropic compressible ﬂuid (problem 16.11).

In the third step we have used that the point x at time t of a comoving curve is found at x + v(x, t)δt at time
t + δt, and this generates the comoving derivative in the fourth line. The Euler equation (16.1) is then used
in the ﬁfth step. Finally, since gravity and the pressure term are both gradient ﬁelds, their integrals around
a closed curve vanish, and we arrive at Kelvin’s theorem.

16.7 Potential ﬂow
A ﬂow that is irrotational in some region of space will in the absence of viscosity stay irrotational at all
times. From Stokes’ theorem it follows that the circulation must vanish around any closed curve, and from
the general result about vector ﬁelds with vanishing circulation (proven on page 39), we conclude that the
velocity ﬁeld is a gradient,
v=∇ .

(16.60)

The scalar ﬁeld is called the ﬂow potential or the velocity potential1 . Potential ﬂow obeys a much simpler
formalism than ﬂow with vorticity, in particular when it is also incompressible. The results to be derived
below for non-viscous incompressible ﬂow can be generalized to compressible ﬂow, although much of the
simplicity is lost (see problem 16.12).

Incompressible potential ﬂow
In an incompressible ﬂuid, the vanishing of the divergence of the velocity ﬁeld implies that the ﬂow potential
must satisfy the Laplace equation,
∇2

= 0.

(16.61)

Typically, the boundary conditions consist of requiring the normal velocity n · v = n · ∇ to vanish at all
impermeable solid walls. If the ﬂow has constant velocity v(x) = U, the ﬂow potential becomes = U · x,
which evidently satisﬁes the Laplace equation.
Inserting ω = 0 and v = ∇ into the Euler equation in the form (16.54) we immediately ﬁnd
∇(H + ∂ /∂t) = 0. This means that H + ∂ /∂t can only depend on time. Inserting the Bernoulli
function (16.15) and solving for the pressure we obtain,
p = C − ρ0

1 2
v +
2

+

∂
∂t

(16.62)

where C is a possibly time-dependent ‘constant’ and v = ∇ . In steady ﬂow the time derivative ∂ /∂t
is absent. Thus, for incompressible potential ﬂow the pressure is simply obtained from the solution of the
linear Laplace equation (16.61) with suitable boundary conditions. All the original nonlinearity of the Euler
equation has thus been relegated to the expression for the pressure.
1 There is no general agreement on the symbol for the velocity potential, although the preferred notation appears to
be φ. In this book we use to avoid clashes with other uses.

16.8. POTENTIAL FLOW FOR CYLINDER IN CROSS-WIND

223

16.8 Potential ﬂow for cylinder in cross-wind
A circular cylinder of radius a is an inﬁnitely extended three-dimensional object which is invariant under
translations along as well as rotations around its axis. We choose as usual a coordinate system with the
z -axis coinciding with the cylinder (see section B.1 on page 531). An asymptotically uniform ‘cross-wind’
U along the x -axis does not break the longitudinal symmetry, which makes it natural to look for a velocity
potential,
= (x, y), that is independent of z . Alternatively, the potential may be expressed in plane
polar coordinates = (r, φ).

Potential and velocity ﬁeld
Asymptotically, for r → ∞, the potential must approach the ﬁeld of a constant uniform cross-wind,
→ U x = Ur cos φ . The linearity of the Laplace equation (16.61) demands that the potential everywhere
is linear in the asymptotic ﬁeld,
= U cos φ f (r ),

Since all three terms are of order 1/r 2 , we should look for power law solutions of the form, f ∼ r α .
Inserting this into the equation we ﬁnd α = ±1 so that the most general solution is of the form
f = Ar + B/r , where A and B are arbitrary constants. The asymptotic condition implies A = 1, and
B is determined by requiring the radial velocity ﬁeld vr = ∇r to vanish at the surface of the cylinder,
r = a. This leads to B = a 2 , so that the solution is

16.9 Potential ﬂow around a sphere in a stream
The natural coordinates for a sphere of radius a inserted into an asymptotically uniform ﬂow are of course
spherical (section B.2 on page 533) with the z-axis along the asymptotic velocity U . The solution follows
along exactly the same lines as for the cylinder above. The symmetry of the problem implies that the
velocity potential cannot depend on the azimuthal angle, so that = (r, θ).

Potential and velocity ﬁeld
Asymptotically, for r → ∞, the velocity potential has to approach the uniform ﬂow → Ur cos θ, and
the linearity of the Laplace equation (16.61) requires the velocity potential to be linear in the asymptotic
ﬂow,
= U cos θ f (r ).

As for the half cylinder, there is a critical stream velocity beyond which the lift is greater than the weight.
Example 16.9.1 (Half-buried ﬁsh): A spherical ﬁsh with radius a = 10 cm and average density 10%
higher than water (with the swim-bladder deﬂated) lies half buried in the sand at the bottom of a stream.
The critical velocity for lift-off is merely U ≈ 0.6 m s−1 , so this ﬁsh would do much better by ﬂattening
its shape or burrowing deeper.

16.10 D’Alembert’s paradox
Jean le Rond d’Alembert (1717–
83).
French mathematician.
Introduced the concept of partial
differential equations and was the
ﬁrst to solve such an equation.

The absence of drag in steady potential ﬂow which we have explicitly veriﬁed for the cylinder and sphere
may be formally shown to be true for any body shape (see page 454). But since everyday experience tells
us that a steadily moving object is subject to drag from the ﬂuid that surrounds it, even if the viscosity is
vanishingly small, we have exposed a problem called d’Alembert’s paradox.

Drag from the trailing wake
The resolution of the paradox illustrates the risks inherent in the assumption of potential ﬂow. Although
a tiny viscosity may not give rise to an appreciable friction force between body and ﬂuid, it will generate
vorticity close to the surface of the body. The vorticity will then spread into the ﬂuid and produce a trailing
wake behind the moving body, carrying a non-vanishing kinetic energy, and this constant loss of kinetic
energy produces a drag on the body.
In potential ﬂow around an object, the ﬂuid does not create a wake but returns to its original state with
no loss of kinetic energy, implying that there is no resultant drag. Potential ﬂow may be a mathematically
correct solution, but it misses in this case important aspects of the physics of real ﬂow. We shall see in
chapter 29 that d’Alembert’s paradox may in fact be viewed positively as a statement about the smallness
of drag compared to lift for streamlined bodies in nearly ideal ﬂuids, with important consequences for the
emergence of powered ﬂight.

Effective mass in unsteady potential ﬂow
Even if no kinetic energy is lost from the ﬂuid in steady potential ﬂow, there will be kinetic energy in the
ﬂow around the body. In the reference frame where the ﬂuid is asymptotically at rest and the sphere moves
with velocity −U, the total kinetic energy of a sphere and the ﬂuid around it becomes (problem 16.14)

where M is the mass of the sphere and v is the potential ﬂow velocity ﬁeld (16.74). This shows that the
effective mass of the sphere plus ﬂuid is M +1/2m where m = (4π/3)a 3 ρ0 is the mass of the ﬂuid displaced
by the sphere. Apart from the factor of 1/2, Archimedes would have loved this result!
If the sphere moves steadily with constant velocity, the total kinetic energy is also constant, and no
external forces need to perform any work. If the sphere is accelerated by means of an external force ,
˙
˙
the rate of work of this force is U = Ì = (M + m/2)U U . The change in the ﬂow pattern around an
˙
accelerated sphere thus produces an apparent drag force of magnitude = (1/2)m U against the direction
of motion.

½× Ó× ØÝ

All ﬂuids are viscous, except for a component of liquid helium close to absolute zero in temperature. Air,
water and oil all put up resistance to ﬂow, and a part of the money we spend on transport by plane, ship or
car goes to overcome ﬂuid friction, and eventually to heating the atmosphere and the sea.
It is primarily the interplay between the mechanical inertia of a moving ﬂuid and its viscosity which
gives rise to all the interesting and beautiful phenomena, the whirling and the swirling that we are so familiar
with. If a volume of ﬂuid is set into motion, inertia would dictate that it continue in its original motion, were
it not checked by the action of internal shear stresses. Viscosity acts as a brake on the free ﬂow of a ﬂuid and
will eventually make it come to rest in mechanical equilibrium, unless external driving forces continually
supply energy to keep it moving. In an Aristotelian sense the ‘natural’ state of a ﬂuid is thus at rest with
pressure being the only stress component. Disturbing a ﬂuid at rest slightly, setting it into motion with
spatially varying velocity ﬁeld, will to ﬁrst order of approximation generate stresses that depend linearly
on the spatial derivatives of the velocity ﬁeld. Fluids with a linear relationship between stress and velocity
gradients are called Newtonian, and the coefﬁcients in this linear relationship are material constants that
characterize the strength of viscosity.
In this largely theoretical chapter the formalism for Newtonian viscosity will be set up and we shall
derive the famous Navier–Stokes equations for ﬂuids, the central theme for the remainder of the book.
Superﬁcially simple, these nonlinear differential equations remain a formidable challenge to engineers,
physicists and mathematicians.

17.1 Shear viscosity
Consider a ﬂuid ﬂowing steadily along the x-direction with a velocity ﬁeld vx (y) which is independent of
x, but may change with y. Such a ﬁeld could, for example, be created by enclosing a ﬂuid between moving
plates, and is an elementary example of laminar or layered ﬂow. If the velocity ﬁeld has no y-dependence
there should not be any internal friction stresses, because the ﬂuid is then in uniform motion along the
x-axis. If, on the other hand, the velocity grows with y, so that its gradient is positive dvx (y)/d y > 0,
we expect that the ﬂuid immediately above a plane y = const. will drag along the ﬂuid immediately below
because of friction and thus exert a positive shear stress, σx y (y) > 0, on this plane.
It also seems reasonable to expect that a larger velocity gradient will evoke stronger stress, and in
Newton’s law of viscosity the shear stress is simply made proportional to the gradient,
σx y (y) = η

dvx (y)
.
dy

(17.1)

The constant of proportionality, η, is called the coefﬁcient of shear viscosity, the dynamic viscosity, or
simply the viscosity. It is a measure of how strongly the moving layers of ﬂuid are coupled by friction,

and a material constant of the same nature as the shear modulus for elastic materials. We shall see below
(section 17.5) that there is also a bulk coefﬁcient of viscosity corresponding to the elastic bulk modulus, but
that turns out to be rather unimportant in ordinary applications.
The viscosities of naturally occurring ﬂuids range over many orders of magnitude (see table 17.1).
Since dvx /d y has dimension of inverse time, the unit for viscosity η is Pa s (pascal seconds). Although this
unit is sometimes called Poiseuille, there is in fact no special name for it in the standard system of units
(SI). In the older cgs-system it used to be called poise = 0.1 Pa s.

Layers of ﬂuid moving with different velocities give rise to shear
forces because they exchange
molecules with different average
velocities.

In gases where molecules are far apart, internal stresses are caused by the incessant molecular bombardment
of a boundary surface, transferring momentum in both directions across it. In liquids where molecules are in
closer contact, internal stress is caused partly by molecular motion as in gases, and partly by intermolecular
forces. The resultant stress in a liquid is a quite complicated combination of the two effects, and we shall
for this reason limit the following discussion to the molecular origin of shear stress in gases.
Gas molecules move nearly randomly in all directions at speeds much higher than the velocity ﬁeld
v(x, t), which should be understood as the centre-of-mass velocity of a large collection of molecules, and
represents the average non-random component of the molecular motion. In steady laminar planar ﬂow with
velocity vx (y) and positive velocity gradient dvx (y)/d y > 0, a molecule of mass m crossing a surface
element in the plane y = const from above will carry along an average excess of momentum mvx (y) in
the x-direction and therefore exert a force in the x-direction on the material below. Similarly, the material
below will exert an equal and opposite force on the material above.
Let the typical distance between molecular collisions in the gas be λ and the typical time between
collisions τ . The excess of momentum in the x-direction above an area element d S y in a layer of thickness
λ is of the order of

This excess of momentum will be carried along by the fast molecular motion in all directions and about
half of it will cross the surface in time τ . The shear stress may be estimated from the momentum transfer

(17.2)

Using the mean free path of gases (1.3) and identifying vmol ≈ λ/τ as the average molecular velocity (4.1),
this estimate is of the right order.
Example 17.1.1: Air at normal temperature and pressure has ρ ≈ 1.2 kg m−3 , λ ≈ 100 nm, and
vmol ≈ 500 m s−1 , leading to η ≈ 1.5 × 10−5 Pa s in decent agreement with the tabulated value.

Temperature dependence of viscosity
The viscosity of any material depends on temperature. Common experience from kitchen and industry
tells us that most liquids become ‘thinner’ when heated, indicating that the viscosity falls with temperature.
Gases on the other hand become more viscous at higher temperatures, simply because the molecules move
faster at random and thus transport momentum across a surface at a higher rate.
For a gas, the mean free path between collisions is given by (1.3). According to that expression λρ is a
combinations of constants, so that the viscosity η ∼ λρ · λ/τ will depend on the thermodynamic parameters
in the same way as the molecular velocity vmol = λ/τ . From the gas pressure estimate (4.1) we have
√
vmol ≈ 3 p/ρ = 3 RT/ Mmol for an ideal gas. Thus, if the viscosity is η0 at temperature T0 , it will
simply be
η = η0

T

(17.3)

at temperature T , independent of the pressure. The ideal gas viscosity depends only on the absolute
temperature, not on the pressure.

Kinematic viscosity
The viscosity estimate (17.2) seems to point to another measure of viscosity, called the kinematic viscosity1 ,
ν=

η
.
ρ

(17.4)

Since the estimate, ν ∼ λ2 /τ , does not depend on the unit of mass, this parameter is measured in purely
kinematic units of m2 s−1 (in the older cgs-system, the corresponding unit was called stokes = cm2 s−1 =
10−4 m2 s−1 ). In ﬂuids with constant density, it is a material constant at equal footing with the dynamic
viscosity η (see table 17.1). It should be remembered that in an ideal gas we have ρ ∝ p/ T , so that the
kinematic viscosity will depend on both temperature and pressure, ν ∝ T 3/2 / p. In isentropic gases it
always decreases with temperature (problem 17.1).
It is as we shall see the kinematic viscosity which appears in the dynamic equations for the velocity
ﬁeld, rather than the dynamic viscosity. Normally, we would think of air as less viscous than water
and hydrogen as less viscous than olive oil, but under suitable conditions it is really the other way
around. If a ﬂow is driven by inﬂow of ﬂuid with a certain velocity rather than being controlled by
external pressure, air behaves in fact as if it were 10–20 times more viscous than water. But subject
to a given pressure, air is much easier to set into motion than water because it is a thousand times
lighter, and that is what fools our intuition.

17.2 Velocity-driven planar ﬂow
Before turning to the derivation of the Navier–Stokes equations for viscous ﬂow, we shall explore the
concept of shear viscosity a bit further for the simple case of planar ﬂow. Let us, as before, assume that the

ﬂow is laminar and planar with the only non-vanishing velocity component being vx = vx ( y, t), now also
allowing for time dependence. It is rather clear that there can be no advective acceleration in such a ﬁeld,
and formally we also ﬁnd (v · ∇)vx = vx ∇x vx = 0. In the absence of volume and pressure forces, the
Newtonian shear stress (17.1) will be the only non-vanishing component of the stress tensor, and Cauchy’s

A solid object sliding on a plane

Let us ﬁrst return to the case of steady planar laminar ﬂow which this chapter began with. In steady ﬂow the
left-hand side of (17.5) vanishes, and from the vanishing of the right-hand side it follows that the general
solution must be linear, vx = A + By, with arbitrary integration constants A and B . We shall imagine that
the ﬂow is maintained between (in principle inﬁnitely extended) solid plates, one kept at rest at y = 0 and
one moving with constant velocity U at y = d . Where the ﬂuid makes contact with the plates, we require
it to assume the same speed as the plates, in other words vx (0) = 0 and vx (d) = U (this no-slip boundary
condition will be discussed in more detail later). Solving these conditions we ﬁnd A = 0 and B = U/d
such that the ﬁeld between the plates becomes
vx ( y) =

(17.7)

which is independent of y , as one might have expected because in stationary ﬂow the balance of forces

Viscous friction
A thin layer of viscous ﬂuid may be used to lubricate the interface between solid objects. From the above
solution we may calculate the friction force, or drag, exerted on the body by the layer of viscous lubricant
(see also chapter 27). Let the would-be contact area between the body and the surface on which it slides be

The velocity-dependent viscous drag is quite different from the constant drag experienced in solid friction
(see section 9.1 on page 111). The decrease in drag with falling velocity makes the object seem to want to
slide ‘forever’, and this is presumably what makes ice sports such as skiing, skating, sledging and curling
interesting. A thin layer of liquid water acts here as the lubricant. Likewise, it is scary to brake a car on
ice or to aquaplane, because the fall in viscous friction as the speed drops makes the car appear to run away
from you.

Although it formally takes inﬁnite time for the sliding object to come to a full stop, it does so in a ﬁnite
distance! The stopping length grows with the mass of the object which is quite unlike solid friction,
where the stopping length is independent √ the mass. This effect is partially compensated by the dynamic
of
dependence of the layer thickness d ∼ 1/ M on the mass (problem 27.1).
Example 17.2.1 (Curling): In the ice sport of curling, a ‘stone’ with mass M ≈ 20 kg is set into
motion with the aim of bringing it to a full stop at the far end of an ice rink of length L ≈ 40 m. The
area of the highly polished contact surface to the ice is A ≈ 700 cm2 and the initial velocity about
U0 ≈ 3 m s−1 . From (17.11) we obtain the thickness of the ﬂuid layer d ≈ 43 µm which does not
seem unreasonable, and neither does the decay time t0 ≈ 13 s. The players’ intense sweeping of the ice
in front of the moving stone presumably serves to smooth out tiny irregularities in the surface, which
could otherwise slow down the stone.

The dynamic equation (17.5) is a typical diffusion equation with diffusion constant equal to the kinematic
viscosity, ν, also called momentum diffusivity. In general, such an equation leads to a spreading of the
distribution of the diffused quantity, which in this case is the velocity ﬁeld, or perhaps better, the momentum
density ρvx . The generic example of a ﬂow with momentum diffusion is the Gaussian ‘river’,
vx (y, t) = U

(17.12)

which may be veriﬁed to be a solution to (17.5) by direct insertion. This river starts out at t = 0 with
Gaussian width a and maximum velocity U , and spreads with time so that at time t it has width a 2 + 4νt.
Although momentum diffuses away from the centre of the river, the total momentum must remain constant
because there are no external forces acting on the ﬂuid. Kinetic energy is on the other hand dissipated and
ends up as heat (see problem 17.3).
For sufﬁciently large times, t
a 2 /4ν, the shape of the Gaussian becomes independent of the original
width a. This is, in fact, a general feature of any bounded ‘river’ ﬂow: it eventually becomes proportional to
√
4νt and it appears
exp(−y 2 /4νt) (see problem 17.6). The Gaussian factor drops sharply to zero for y
√
as if momentum diffusion has a fairly well-deﬁned front, which for example may be taken to be y = 2 νt
−1 = 37% of its central value. Depending on the application, it is sometimes
where the Gaussian is e
√
convenient to choose a more conservative estimate for the spread of momentum, for example y = k νt,
where for k = 3 the Gaussian factor is only 10% of its central value.
Momentum diffusion may equivalently be characterized by the time it takes for a velocity disturbance
to spread through a distance L by diffusion,

or a correspondingly more conservative estimate. It must be emphasized that momentum diffusion (in
this case) takes place orthogonally to the general direction of motion of the ﬂuid. In spite of the fact that
momentum diffuses away from the centre in the y-direction, there is no mass ﬂow in the y-direction because
v y = 0. In less restricted ﬂows there may be more direct competition between mass ﬂow and diffusion. If
the velocity scale of a ﬂow is |v| ∼ U , it would take the time tﬂow ∼ L/U for the ﬂuid to move through the

distance L , and the ratio of the the diffusion time scale tdiff ∼ L 2 /ν to the mass ﬂow time scale becomes a
dimensionless number Re ≈ tdiff / tﬂow ∼ U L/ν , ﬁrst used by Reynolds to classify different ﬂows. When
this number is large compared to unity, momentum diffusion takes a much longer time than mass ﬂow and
plays only a small role, whereas when Re is small momentum diffusion wins over mass ﬂow and dominates
the ﬂow pattern. The Reynolds number is a very useful parameter which will be discussed in more detail in
section 17.4.

Shear sound waves
Consider an inﬁnitely extended plate in contact with an inﬁnite sea of ﬂuid. Let the plate oscillate with
circular frequency ω, so that its instantaneous velocity in the x -direction is U (t) = U0 cos ωt . The motion
of the plate is transferred to the neighbouring ﬂuid because of the no-slip condition and then spreads into
the ﬂuid at large. How far does it go? By direct insertion into (17.5) it is found that

satisﬁes the planar ﬂow equation (17.5) as well as the no-slip boundary condition vx = U (t) for y = 0.
Evidently, this is a damped wave spreading from the oscillating plate into the ﬂuid. Since the velocity
oscillations take place in the x -direction whereas the wave propagates in the y -direction it is a transverse
or shear wave. The wavenumber k both determines the wavelength λ = 2π/ k and the decay length of
the exponential, also called the penetration depth d = 1/ k = λ/2π . The wave is critically damped and
penetrates less than one wavelength into the ﬂuid, so it is really not much of a wave. Although longitudinal
(pressure) waves are also attenuated by viscosity, they propagate over much greater distances (see section
17.6).
Example 17.2.2: A shear sound wave in air of frequency 1000 Hz has wavelength 0.4 mm, whereas in
water it is 0.1 mm.

17.3 Incompressible Newtonian ﬂuids
Numerous everyday ﬂuids obey Newton’s law of viscosity (17.1), for example water, air, oil, alcohol and
antifreeze. A number of common ﬂuids are only approximatively Newtonian, for example paint and blood,
and others are strongly non-Newtonian, for example tomato ketchup, jelly and putty. There also exist
viscoelastic materials that are both elastic and viscous, sometimes used in toys that can be deformed like
clay but also jump like a rubber ball.

In Newtonian ﬂuids the shear stress σx y is directly proportional to the velocity gradient ∇ y vx (also
called the shear strain rate) with proportionality constant equal to the constant shear viscosity η.
Most non-Newtonian ﬂuids become thinner as the shear strain rate increases, implying that the shear
stress as a function of shear strain rate grows slower than linearly. Even the most Newtonian of
ﬂuids, water, becomes thinner at shear strain rates above 1012 s−1 . Only few ﬂuids (for example
some starches stirred in water) appear to thicken with increasing strain rate. The science of the
general ﬂow properties of materials is called rheology.

thick

∇ y vx

In Newtonian ﬂuids the shear
stress σx y increases linearly with
the strain-rate ∇ y vx , whereas
non-Newtonian ﬂuids mostly become thinner and only a few become thicker.

Most everyday liquids are incompressible, and gases are effectively so when the ﬂow velocities are
much smaller than the velocity of sound (see section 16.4). We shall in this section only establish the general
dynamical equations for the simpler case of incompressible, isotropic Newtonian ﬂuids and postpone the
analysis of the slightly more complicated compressible ﬂuids to section 17.5.

Isotropic viscous stress
Newton’s law of viscosity (17.1) is a linear relation between the stress and the velocity gradient, only valid
in a particular geometry. As for Hooke’s law for elasticity (page 137) we want a more general deﬁnition of
viscous stress which takes the same form for any geometry and in any Cartesian coordinate system, leaving
us free to choose our own reference frame.

17.3. INCOMPRESSIBLE NEWTONIAN FLUIDS

235

Most ﬂuids are not only Newtonian, but also isotropic. Liquid crystals are anisotropic, but so special
that we shall not consider them here. In an isotropic ﬂuid at rest there are no internal directions at all and the
stress tensor is determined by the pressure, σi j = − p δi j . When such a ﬂuid is set in motion, the velocity
ﬁeld vi ( x, t) deﬁnes a direction in every point of space, but as we have argued before the velocity at a point
cannot itself provoke stress in the ﬂuid. It is the variation in velocity from point to point that causes stress.
Viscous stress is in other words determined by the velocity gradient tensor ∇i v j .
In an incompressible ﬂuid, the trace of the velocity gradient matrix vanishes, i ∇i vi = ∇ · v = 0, so
the most general symmetric tensor one can construct from the velocity gradients is of the form,
σi j = − p δi j + η (∇i v j + ∇ j vi ).

(17.15)

This is the natural generalization of Newton’s law of viscosity (17.1) for incompressible ﬂow in arbitrary
Cartesian coordinate systems. It may readily be veriﬁed that the coefﬁcient η is indeed the shear viscosity
introduced in Newton’s law by inserting the ﬁeld of a steady planar ﬂow v = (vx ( y), 0, 0), because for
such a ﬁeld the only shear stress is σx y = σ yx = η∇ y vx ( y).

The Navier–Stokes equations for incompressible ﬂuid
The right-hand side of Cauchy’s general equation of motion (15.35) equals the effective density of force
f i∗ = fi + j ∇ j σi j . Inserting the stress tensor (17.15) and using again ∇ · v = 0, we ﬁnd
∇ j σi j = −∇i p + η

Here we have tacitly assumed that the ﬂuid is homogeneous such that the shear viscosity (like the density ρ )
does not depend on x . If the temperature or chemical composition of the ﬂuid varies in space, the right-hand
side must be modiﬁed.
Inserting this expression into Cauchy’s equation of motion and converting to ordinary vector notation
we ﬁnally obtain the Navier–Stokes equation for incompressible ﬂuid (Navier (1822), Stokes (1845))

where ρ0 is the constant density, ν = η/ρ0 is the kinematic viscosity and g = f /ρ0 is the acceleration
ﬁeld of the volume forces (normally due to gravity). The only difference from the Euler equation (16.1)
is the last term on the right-hand side. Besides this equation, we have also the divergence condition for
incompressibility,
∇ · v = 0.

(17.17)

Given the acceleration ﬁeld g, we now have four equations for the four ﬁelds, vx , v y , vz , and p. Note,
however, that whereas the three velocity ﬁelds obey truly dynamic equations with each ﬁeld having its
own time derivative, this is not the case for the pressure which is only determined indirectly through the
divergence condition.
Relatively simple to look at, the Navier–Stokes equations contain all the complexity of real ﬂuid ﬂow,
including that of Niagara Falls! It is therefore clear that one cannot in general expect to ﬁnd simple
solutions. Exact solutions can only be found in strongly restricted geometries and under simplifying
assumptions concerning the nature of the ﬂow, as in the planar laminar ﬂow examples in the preceding
section, and the examples to be studied in chapter 18.

Millenium Prize Problem: Among the seven Millenium Prize Problems set out by the Clay
Mathematics Institute of Cambridge, Massachusetts, one concerns the existence of smooth, nonsingular solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations (even for the simpler case of incompressible ﬂow).
The prize money of one million dollars illustrates how little we know and how much we would like
to know about the general features of these equations which appear to defy the standard analytic
methods for solving partial differential equations.

17. VISCOSITY

Boundary conditions
Field equations that are ﬁrst order in time, like the Navier–Stokes equation (17.16), need initial values of the
ﬁelds (and their spatial derivatives) in order to predict their values at later times. But what about physical
boundaries, the containers of ﬂuids, or even internal boundaries between different ﬂuids? How do the ﬁelds
behave there? Let us discuss the various ﬁelds that we have met one by one.

Density: The density is easy to dispose of, since it is allowed to be discontinuous and jump at a boundary
between two materials, so this provides us with no condition at all. It is evident from the Navier–Stokes
equation that a jump in density across a ﬂuid boundary must somehow be accompanied by a jump in the
derivatives of the other ﬁelds, but we shall not go into this question here.
Pressure: Newton’s third law requires the pressure to be continuous across any boundary. This simple
picture is, however, complicated by surface tension, which can give rise to a discontinuous jump in pressure
across an interface between two materials.

Velocity: The normal component vn = v · n of the velocity ﬁeld must be continuous across any boundary,
for the simple reason that what goes in on one side must come out on the other. If this were not the case,
material would collect at the boundary or holes would develop in the ﬂuid. The latter kind of breakdown
can actually happen in extreme situations (cavitation).

Sketch of rapidly varying velocUsually the whole velocity ﬁeld, normal as well as tangential components, will therefore be assumed
ity and shear stress in a region to be continuous across any boundary between Newtonian ﬂuids. Since a solid wall may be viewed as an
of size a near a boundary. For extreme Newtonian ﬂuid with inﬁnite viscosity, we recover the previously mentioned no-slip condition:
a → 0 the velocity develops an a ﬂuid has zero velocity relative to its containing walls. Viscous ﬂuids never slip along the containing
abrupt jump and the stress be- boundaries but adhere to them, and this is part of the reason that viscous ﬂuids are wet. Another reason for
comes singular. The decrease in a ﬂuid to be able to wet a solid surface is an acute contact angle (see chapter 8).
shear stress away from the discontinuity leads to spreading of
∗ Viscous dissipation
the sharp discontinuity.
When you gently and steadily stir a pot of soup, the ﬂuid will after some time settle down into a nearly
steady ﬂow. The fact that you still have to perform work while you stir steadily, shows that there must be
viscous friction forces at play in the soup. The friction forces between the sides of the pot and the soup
cannot perform any work because the ﬂuid is at rest there, due to the no-slip condition. All the work you
perform must for this reason be spent against the internal friction forces, the shear stresses acting between
the moving layers of the ﬂuid. If you stop stirring the kinetic energy of the soup is quickly dissipated into
heat. We shall return to dissipation in chapters 22 and 30.
To make a quick calculation of the dissipative rate of work, we turn back to the discussion of
deformation work on page 129. Since a ﬂuid particle is displaced by δu = v δt in a small time
interval δt, ﬂuid motion may be seen as a continuous sequence of inﬁnitesimal deformations with strain
tensor, δu i j = (1/2)(∇i δu j + ∇ j δu i ) = (1/2)(∇i v j + ∇ j vi ) δt. The symmetrized velocity gradients
vi j ≡ δu i j /δt = (1/2)(∇i v j + ∇ j vi ) may thus be understood as the rate of deformation or rate of strain of
˙
the ﬂuid material. The rate of work W = δW/δt performed against the internal stresses is correspondingly
given by (10.36),

where in the last step we have inserted the Newtonian stress tensor (17.15). Evidently, the rate of work
against internal shear stresses is always positive. It always costs work to keep things moving against friction
forces.

∗ Non-locality of pressure
For incompressible ﬂuids, the pressure is not given by an equation of state, but rather determined by the
divergence condition, and that leads to special difﬁculties. Calculating the divergence of both sides of
(17.16), we obtain a Poisson equation for the pressure,
∇ 2 p = ρ0 −∇ · ((v · ∇)v) + ∇ · g .

(17.19)

A solution to the Poisson equation is generally of the same form as the gravitational potential from a mass
distribution (3.24) and depends non-locally on the ﬁeld (the source) on the right-hand side. The non-local
pressure therefore instantly communicates any change in the velocity ﬁeld to the rest of the ﬂuid.
Like true rigidity, true incompressibility is an ideal which cannot be reached with real materials, where
the velocity of sound sets an upper limit to small-amplitude signal propagation speed. The above result
nevertheless means that any local change in the ﬂow will be communicated by the non-local pressure to
any other parts of the ﬂuid at the speed of sound. This phenomenon is in fact well-known from everyday
experience where the closing of a faucet can result in rather violent so-called ‘water-hammer’ responses
from the house piping. The non-locality of pressure is also a major problem in numerical simulations of the
Navier–Stokes equations for incompressible ﬂuids (see chapter 21).

17.4 Classiﬁcation of ﬂows
The most interesting phenomena in ﬂuid dynamics arise from the competition between inertia and viscosity,
represented in the Navier–Stokes equation (17.16) by the advective term (v·∇)v and the viscous term ν∇ 2 v .
Inertia attempts to continue the motion of a ﬂuid once it is started whereas viscosity acts as a brake. If inertia
is dominant we may leave out the viscous term, arriving again at Euler’s equation (16.1) describing lively,
non-viscous or ideal ﬂow (see chapter 16). If on the other hand viscosity is dominant, we may drop the
advective term, and obtain the basic equations for sluggish creeping ﬂow (see chapter 19).

The Reynolds number
As a measure of how much an actual ﬂow is lively or sluggish, one may make a rough estimate, called
the Reynolds number, for the magnitude of the ratio of the advective to the viscous terms. To get a simple
expression we assume that the velocity is of typical size |v| ≈ U and that it changes by a similar amount
over a region of size L . The order of magnitude of the ﬁrst-order spatial derivatives of the velocity will then
be of magnitude |∇v| ≈ U/L, and the second-order derivatives will be ∇ 2 v ≈ U/L 2 . Consequently, the
Reynolds number becomes
Re ≈

|(v · ∇)v|
|ν∇ 2 v|

≈

(17.20)

For small values of the Reynolds number, Re
1, advection plays no role and the ﬂow creeps along,
whereas for large values, Re
1, viscosity can be ignored and the ﬂow tends to be lively. The streamline
pattern of creeping ﬂow is orderly and layered, also called laminar, well known from the kitchen when
mixing cocoa into dough to make a chocolate cake (although dough is hardly Newtonian!). The laminar ﬂow
pattern continues quite far beyond Re 1, but depending on the ﬂow geometry and other circumstances,
there will be a Reynolds number, typically in the region of thousands, where turbulence sets in with its
characteristic tumbling and chaotic behaviour.
It is often quite easy to estimate the Reynolds number from the geometry and boundary conditions of a
ﬂow pattern, as is done in the following examples and in table 17.2.
Example 17.4.1 (Bathtub turbulence): Getting out of a bathtub you create ﬂows with speeds of say
U ≈ 1 m s−1 over a distance of L ≈ 1 m. The Reynolds number becomes Re ≈ 106 and you are
deﬁnitely creating visible turbulence in the water. Similarly, when jogging you create air ﬂows with

U ≈ 3 m s−1 and L ≈ 1 m, leading to a Reynolds number around 2 × 105 , and you know that you
must leave all kinds of little invisible turbulent eddies in the air behind you. The fact that the Reynolds
number is smaller in air than in water despite the higher velocity is a consequence of the kinematic
viscosity being larger for air than for water.

Example 17.4.2 (Curling): For planar ﬂow between two plates (section 17.1), the velocity scale is
set by the velocity difference U between the plates whereas the length scale is set by the distance d
between the plates. In the curling example 17.2.1 on page 233 we found U ≈ 3 m s−1 and d ≈ 43 µm,
leading to a Reynolds number Re = U d/ν ≈ 140. Although not truly creeping ﬂow, it is deﬁnitely
laminar and not turbulent.

Example 17.4.3 (Water pipe): A typical 1/2 inch water pipe has diameter d ≈ 1.25 cm and that sets
the length scale. If the volume ﬂux of water is Q = 100 cm3 s−1 , the average water speed becomes
U = Q/πa 2 ≈ 0.8 m s−1 and we get a Reynolds number Re = U d/ν ≈ 104 which brings the ﬂow
well into the turbulent regime. For olive oil under otherwise identical conditions we get Re ≈ 0.15, and
the ﬂow would be creeping.

Hydrodynamic similarity
What does it mean if two ﬂows have the same Reynolds number? A stone of size L = 1 m sitting in a steady
water ﬂow with velocity U = 2 m s−1 has the same Reynolds number as another stone of size L = 2 m in
a steady water ﬂow with velocity U = 1 m s−1 . It even has the same Reynolds number as a stone of size
L = 4 m in a steady airﬂow with velocity U = 8 m s−1 , because the kinematic viscosity of air is about 16
times larger than of water (at normal temperature and pressure). We shall now see that provided the stones
are geometrically similar, i.e. have congruent geometrical shapes, ﬂows with the same Reynolds numbers
are also hydrodynamically similar and only differ by their overall length and velocity scales, so that their
ﬂow patterns visualized by streamlines will look identical.
In the absence of volume forces, steady incompressible ﬂow is determined by (17.16) with g = 0 and

(17.23)

The only parameter appearing in this equation is the Reynolds number which may be interpreted as the
inverse of the dimensionless kinematic viscosity. The pressure is as mentioned not an independent dynamic
variable and its scale is here ﬁxed by the velocity scale, P = ρ0 U 2 . If the ﬂow instead is driven by external
pressure differences of magnitude P rather than by velocity, the equivalent ﬂow velocity scale is given by
√
U = P/ρ0 .
In congruent ﬂow geometries, the no-slip boundary conditions will also be the same, so that any solution
of the dimensionless equation can be scaled back to a solution of the original equation by means of (17.22).
The three different ﬂows around stones mentioned at the beginning of this subsection may thus all be
obtained from the same dimensionless solution if the stones are geometrically similar and the Reynolds
numbers identical.
Even if the ﬂows are similar in air and water, the forces exerted on the stones will, however, not be
the same. The shear stress magnitude may be estimated as σ ≈ η |∇v| ∼ ηU/L, times a function of the
Reynolds number. The viscous drag on an object of size L will then be of magnitude ≈ σ L 2 ∼ ηU L =
ηνRe. Since the Reynolds numbers are assumed to be the same in the two cases, the ratio of the viscous
drag on the stone in air to that in water is about air / water ≈ (ην)air /(ην)water ≈ 0.27.
Example 17.4.4 (Flight of the roboﬂy): The similarity of ﬂows in congruent geometries can be
exploited to study the ﬂow around tiny insects by means of enlarged slower moving models, immersed
in another ﬂuid. It is, for example, hard to study the air ﬂow around the wing of a hovering fruit
ﬂy, when the wing ﬂaps f = 50 times per second. For a wing size of L ≈ 4 mm ﬂapping through
180 ◦ the average velocity becomes U ≈ π L f ≈ 1.3 m s−1 and the corresponding Reynolds number
Re ≈ U L/ν ≈ 160. The same Reynolds number can be obtained (see J. M. Birch and M. H. Dickinson,
Nature 412, (2001) 729) from a 19 cm plastic wing of the same shape, ﬂapping once every 6 s in mineral
oil with kinematic viscosity ν = 1.15 cm2 s−1 , allowing for easy recording of the ﬂow around the wing.

Example 17.4.5 (High-pressure wind tunnels): In the early days of ﬂight, wind tunnels were
extensively used for empirical studies of lift and drag on scaled-down models of wings and aircraft.
Unfortunately, the smaller geometrical sizes of the models reduced the attainable Reynolds number
below that of real aircraft in ﬂight. A solution to the problem was obtained by operating wind tunnels
at much higher than atmospheric pressure. Since the dynamic viscosity η is independent of pressure
(page 231), the Reynolds number Re = ρ0 U L/η scales with the air density and thus with pressure.
The famous Variable Density Tunnel (VDT) built in 1922 by the US National Advisory Committee for
Aeronautics (NACA) operated on a pressure of 20 atm and was capable of attaining full-scale Reynolds
numbers for models only 1/20th of the size of real aircraft [3, p. 301]. The results obtained from the
VDT had great inﬂuence on aircraft design in the following 20 years.
In the presence of external volume forces, for example gravity, or for time-dependent inﬂow, the ﬂow
patterns will depend on further dimensionless quantities besides the Reynolds number. We shall only
introduce such quantities when they arise naturally in particular cases. Flows in different geometries can
only be compared in a coarse sense, even if they have the same Reynolds number. A running man has
the same Reynolds number as a swimming herring, and a ﬂying gnat the same Reynolds number as a
man swimming in castor oil (which cannot be recommended). In both cases the ﬂow geometries are quite

17. VISCOSITY
different, leading to different streamline patterns. Here the Reynolds number can only be used to indicate
the character of the ﬂow which tends to be turbulent around the running man and laminar around the ﬂying
gnat.

17.5 Compressible Newtonian ﬂuids
When ﬂow velocities become a ﬁnite fraction of the velocity of sound, it is no longer possible to maintain
the simplifying assumption of effective incompressibility. Whereas submarines and ships never come near
such velocities, passenger jets routinely operate at speeds up to 90% of the velocity of sound, and rockets,
military aircraft, the Concorde and the Space Shuttle, are all capable of ﬂying at supersonic and even
hypersonic speeds. In these cases it is necessary to modify the Navier–Stokes equation.

Shear and bulk viscosity
In compressible ﬂuids the divergence of the velocity ﬁeld is non-vanishing. This opens up the possibility of
adding a term proportional to (∇ · v)δi j to the isotropic stress tensor (17.15),
σi j = − p δi j + η ∇i v j + ∇ j vi + a∇ · v δi j .

(17.24)

Demanding as usual that the pressure is the average of the three normal stresses, p = − i σii /3, the trace
of this expression becomes −3 p = −3 p + 2η∇ · v + 3a∇ · v = 0, so that we must have a = −(2/3)η. The
complete stress tensor thus takes the form,
σi j = − p δi j + η

∇i v j + ∇ j vi −

2
∇ · v δi j
3

.

(17.25)

This stress tensor may be viewed as a ﬁrst-order expansion in the velocity gradients. In the same
approximation the pressure may also depend linearly on the velocity gradients, but since the pressure is
a scalar it can only depend on the scalar divergence ∇ · v, so the most general form of the mechanical
pressure must be
p = pe − ζ ∇ · v,

(17.26)

with coefﬁcients pe and ζ that may depend on the density ρ and temperature T . In mechanical equilibrium,
v = 0, we have p = pe = pe (ρ, T ), which must be the thermodynamic pressure given by the equation of
state.
The new parameter ζ is called the bulk viscosity or the expansion viscosity. Its presence implies that a
viscous ﬂuid in motion exerts an extra dynamic pressure of size −ζ ∇ · v. The dynamic pressure is negative
in regions where the ﬂuid expands (∇ · v > 0), positive where it contracts (∇ · v < 0), and vanishes for
incompressible ﬂuids. Bulk viscosity is hard to measure, because one must set up physical conditions such
that expansion and contraction become important, for example by means of high frequency sound waves.
In the following section we shall calculate the viscous attenuation of sound in ﬂuids, and see that it depends
on the bulk modulus. The measurement of attenuation of sound is quite complicated and yields a rather
frequency-dependent bulk viscosity, although it is generally of the same magnitude as the coefﬁcient of
shear viscosity.

The Navier–Stokes equation
Inserting the modiﬁed stress tensor (17.25) into Cauchy’s equation of motion we obtain the ﬁeld equation,

we have obtained four dynamic equations for the four ﬁelds vx , v y , vz and ρ, and one constitutive relation
(17.26) for the pressure p as a function of the thermodynamic variables and the velocity ﬁeld.

∗ Viscous dissipation
For compressible ﬂuids the rate of work against internal stresses is slightly more complicated than for
incompressible ﬂuids (17.18). Deﬁning the traceless shear strain rate
vi j =

,

(17.29)

the stress tensor (17.25) takes the form σi j = − pδi j + 2ηvi j . Using the symmetry and tracelessness of vi j
we have i j σi j ∇ j vi = − p∇ · v + 2η i j vi2j , and inserting the mechanical pressure from (17.26) we
obtain the total rate of work against internal stresses,

This expression reduces of course to (17.18) for ∇ · v = 0. The ﬁrst term represents the familiar
thermodynamic rate of work on the ﬂuid. It is positive during compression (∇ · v < 0) and negative
during expansion, and may in principle be recovered completely under under adiabatic conditions. The last
two terms represent the work against internal viscous stresses and are always positive. In particular we note
that the second term due to the bulk viscosity is positive whether the ﬂow expands or contracts. Both the
bulk and shear terms contribute to the attenuation of sound, as we shall see in the following section.

∗ 17.6 Viscous attenuation of sound
It has previously (on page 234) been shown that free shear waves do not propagate through more than
about one wavelength from their origin in any type of ﬂuid. In nearly ideal ﬂuids such as air and water, free
pressure waves are as everybody knows capable of propagating over many wavelengths. Viscous dissipation
(and many other effects) will nevertheless slowly sap their strength, and in the end all of the kinetic energy
of the waves will be converted into heat.
In this section we shall calculate the rate of attenuation from damped-wave small-amplitude solutions
to the Navier–Stokes equations. The attenuation may as well be calculated from the general expression for
the dissipative work (17.30).

The wave equation
As in the discussion of unattenuated pressure waves in section 16.2 on page 206 we assume to begin with
that a barotropic ﬂuid is in hydrostatic equilibrium without gravity, v = 0, so that its density ρ = ρ0 and
pressure p = p(ρ0 ) are constant throughout. Consider now a disturbance in the form of a small-amplitude
motion of the ﬂuid, described by a velocity ﬁeld v which is so tiny that the nonlinear advective term
(v · ∇)v can be completely disregarded. This disturbance will be accompanied by tiny density corrections,
ρ = ρ − ρ0 , and pressure corrections p = p − p0 , which we assume to be of ﬁrst order in the velocity.
Dropping all higher order terms, the linearized Navier–Stokes equations become (in the absence of gravity),

If the last term on the right-hand side were absent, this would be a standard wave equation of the form

viscous attenuation.

The time derivative in the last term is of order ω ρ for a wave with circular frequency ω, and in view of
the huge values of the viscous frequency scale ω0 , the ratio of the terms ω/ω0 will be small, implying that
attenuation is weak for normal sound, including ultrasound in the megahertz region.

Damped plane wave
Let us assume that a wave is created by an inﬁnitely extended plane, a ‘loudspeaker’, situated at x = 0 and
oscillating in the x-direction with a small amplitude at a deﬁnite circular frequency ω. The ﬂuid near the
plate has to follow the plate and will be alternately compressed and expanded, thereby generating a damped
density (or pressure) wave of the form,

The viscous amplitude attenuation coefﬁcient grows quadratically with the frequency, causing high
frequency sound to be attenuated much more by viscosity than low frequency sound.
In air the viscous attenuation length determined by this expression is huge, about 1/κ ≈ 50 km, at a
frequency of 1000 Hz. At 1 MHz it is a million times shorter, about 1/κ ≈ 5 cm. Diagnostic imaging
typically uses ultrasound between 1 and 15 MHz, but since living tissue is mostly water with higher density
and sound velocity, the attenuation length is much longer than in air. The drastic reduction in attenuation
length 1/κ with increased frequency is also what makes measurements of the attenuation coefﬁcient much

easier at high frequencies. From the viscous attenuation coefﬁcient one may in principle extract the value
of the bulk viscosity, but this is complicated by several other fundamental mechanisms that also attenuate
sound, such as thermal conductivity, and excitation of molecular rotations and vibrations.
In the real atmosphere, many other effects contribute to the attenuation of sound. First, sound is
mostly emitted from point sources rather than from inﬁnitely extended vibrating planes, and that
introduces a quadratic drop in amplitude with distance. Other factors like humidity, dust, impurities
and turbulence also contribute, in fact much more than viscosity at the relatively low frequencies
that human activities generate (see for example [22, appendix] for a discussion of the basic physics
of sound waves in gases).

Even the most common of ﬂuid ﬂows, the water coming out of the kitchen tap or the draught of air around
you, are so full of little eddies that their description seems totally beyond exact analysis. Fluid mechanics
is the story of coarse approximation, gross oversimpliﬁcation, and if accurate results are required, numeric
computation.
Analytic solutions of the Navier–Stokes equations are few and hard to come by, even for steady ﬂow.
They are always found in geometries characterized by a high degree of symmetry, for example planar,
cylindrical or spherical. Then again, even if the geometry of a problem—the containing boundaries—is
perfectly symmetric, there is no guarantee that the analytic solutions obeying these symmetries are the ones
that the actual ﬂuid selects as its ﬂow pattern.
Symmetry is only a guideline. In any geometry there may and will be ﬂows that are not maximally
symmetric. At low Reynolds number one expects that the maximally symmetric solution might be stable
against disturbances, but at large Reynolds number this will not be the case. The simple laminar ﬂow
pattern of the maximally symmetric steady ﬂow is then broken spontaneously or by little irregularities in
the geometry, and replaced by time-dependent ﬂow with less than maximal symmetry, or no symmetry at
all.
In this chapter we shall study steady laminar ﬂow in the simplest of geometries: planar and cylindrical.
The exact solutions presented here are all effectively one-dimensional and thus lead to ordinary differential
equations that are easy to solve. Although the solutions are all of inﬁnite extent they nevertheless provide
valuable insight into the behaviour of viscous ﬂuids for moderate Reynolds number. Many ﬂows of
interest are more complicated than these solutions, and we include in this chapter a discussion of the
phenomenology of turbulent pipe ﬂow and secondary ﬂow between rotating cylinders.

18.1 Steady, incompressible, viscous ﬂow
Most of the ﬂuids encountered in daily life, water, air, gasoline and oil, are effectively incompressible as
long as ﬂow velocities are well below the speed of sound, and often they ﬂow steadily through the channels
and pipes that we use to guide them. In looking for exact solutions for viscous ﬂow, we shall therefore
make the simplifying assumptions that the ﬂow is incompressible and steady, satisfying the Navier–Stokes
equation (17.16) and the divergence condition,
(v · ∇)v = g −
∇·v =0

where ρ0 is the constant density and ν is the kinematic viscosity (17.4). These four partial differential
equations determine in principle the four ﬁelds, vx , v y , vz and p, throughout a volume, when provided with
suitable boundary conditions that ﬁx the values of the ﬁelds or their derivatives on the surface of the volume.

246

18. PLATES AND PIPES
In practice, however, we often solve these equations by making assumptions about the form of the
ﬁelds, based on the symmetries of the particular problem at hand. Symmetry assumptions limit the
possible boundary conditions that may be imposed on the ﬁelds. In the absence of gravity, the ﬁeld
equations are, for example, always solved by the extremely ‘symmetric’ solution, v = 0 and p = 0,
but this assumption prevents us from selecting any non-zero values for the ﬁelds or their derivatives
on the boundaries. Symmetry assumptions also make the solution blind to the symmetry breakdown
that may happen in the real world of ﬂuids. So it should never be forgotten that although symmetric
solutions can be beautiful, they may also be completely irrelevant!

Planar ﬂow between parallel
plates.

In section 17.2 we analysed velocity-driven planar ﬂow between inﬁnitely extended parallel plates, where
one of the plates was moving at constant velocity with respect to the other. Here we shall solve the case
where the plates are ﬁxed and ﬂuid is driven between them by means of a pressure difference. For simplicity
we assume that there is no gravity; gravity-driven ﬂow will be analysed in the following section.
The coordinate system is chosen with the x-axis pointing along the direction of ﬂow and the y-axis
orthogonal to the plates. A velocity ﬁeld respecting the planar symmetry is of the form,
v = (vx (y), 0, 0) = vx (y) e x .

(18.2)

An inﬁnitely extended ﬂow like this is of course unphysical, but should nevertheless offer an approximation
to the real ﬂow between plates of ﬁnite extent, provided the dimensions of the plates are sufﬁciently large
compared to their mutual distance.

General solution
With the assumed form of the ﬂow, the incompressibility condition (18.1b) is automatically fulﬁlled,
∇ · v = ∇x vx (y) = 0. The advective acceleration vanishes likewise, (v · ∇)v = vx (y)∇x vx (y)ex = 0.
The Navier–Stokes equation (18.1a) then takes the form,
∇ p = η ex ∇ 2 vx (y).
From the y and z components of this equation we get ∇ y p = ∇z p = 0, implying that the pressure cannot
depend on y and z, or in other words p = p(x). The x-component then takes the form,
d 2 vx (y)
d p(x)
.
=η
dx
d y2

(18.3)

The left-hand side depends only on x and the right-hand side only on y, and that is only possible, if both
sides take the same value independently of both x and y. Denoting the common value −G, we may
immediately solve each of the equations d p/d x = −G and ηd 2 vx /d y 2 = −G with the result,
p = p0 − Gx,

integration constants, and they will be ﬁxed by the boundary conditions of the speciﬁc ﬂow conﬁguration.

Let the plates be positioned a distance d apart, for example at y = 0 and y = d. Applying the no-slip
boundary conditions, vx (0) = vx (d) = 0, to the general solution, we obtain A = Gd/2η and B = 0, so the

It has a characteristic parabolic shape with the maximal velocity vx |max = Gd 2 /8η in the middle of the

The velocity proﬁle depends on the (negative) pressure gradient G in the direction of ﬂow. It may be
calculated from the pressure drop between x = 0 where the pressure is p0 and x = L where the pressure
is p1 , where p = p0 − p1 is the magnitude of the pressure drop over the distance L in the direction of

Reynolds number
The Reynolds number (17.20) has been deﬁned in general as the ratio between advective and viscous terms
in the Navier–Stokes equation, but since the advective acceleration (v · ∇)v always vanishes in planar ﬂow,
the Reynolds number must strictly speaking be zero. How can that be?
The apparent paradox is resolved when we consider what happens when the driving pressure is
increased. Laminar ﬂow is then replaced by irregular, time-dependent, turbulent ﬂow with non-vanishing
advective acceleration. The Reynolds number should be understood as a dimensionless characterization of
the ratio of advective to viscous forces in terms of the speed and geometry of the general ﬂow. Since the
velocity changes by about U across the gap, the Reynolds number for pressure driven ﬂow between parallel
plates is conventionally deﬁned as,
Ud
,
ν

(18.9)

independent of whether the ﬂow is laminar or turbulent. Pressure-driven planar ﬂow is stable1 towards
inﬁnitesimal perturbations in the x y-plane for Re < 5772, but empirically the ﬂow becomes turbulent for
Re 1000–2000, accompanied by breakdown of the two-dimensionality of the ﬂow. The phenomenology
of turbulent pressure-driven planar ﬂow is quite similar to that of turbulent pressure-driven pipe ﬂow
(section 18.5).

Example 18.2.1: Oil with η = 2 × 10−2 Pa s and ρ0 = 800 kg m−3 is driven between plates that
are d = 1 cm apart by a pressure drop p = 103 Pa over a distance L = 1 m. The average velocity
becomes in this case U ≈ 0.4 m s−1 corresponding to a Reynolds number of Re ≈ 167. The discharge
rate per unit of length orthogonal to the ﬂow Q/W ≈ 4 × 10−3 m2 /s.

Drag
The ﬂuid exerts a friction force on the bounding walls which is determined by the wall shear stress
σwall = σx y y=0 = η ∇ y vx y=0 = 1 Gd.
2

(18.10)

The total friction force on the walls, also called the drag, is obtained by multiplying the wall shear stress by
the total wall area of both plates,
= σwall 2L W = G L W d =

p W d.

(18.11)

The last result shows that the drag equals the total pressure force on the ﬂuid calculated from the pressure
drop times the inlet area W d. That this must be so could have been foreseen because the only forces acting
on the non-accelerated volume of ﬂuid between the plates are the pressure forces and friction, and they must
therefore balance each other.
Since the pressure is constant over the inlet area, the rate of work of the pressure forces on the ﬂuid is
similarly obtained by multiplying the pressure force by the average velocity,
P = U pW d = U .

Since no other forces perform work on the ﬂuid, this must equal the rate at which viscous forces produce
heat in the ﬂuid, also called dissipation.

18.3 Gravity-driven planar ﬂow
Gravity may also drive the ﬂow between parallel plates if they are inclined an angle θ to the horizon. We
choose again a coordinate system with the x-axis in the direction of ﬂow and the y-axis orthogonal to the
plates. Assuming constant gravity, the gravitational ﬁeld is in this coordinate system inclined an angle θ to
the negative y-axis, so that g = g0 (sin θ, − cos θ, 0).

Flow between inclined parallel plates
The y, z-components of the Navier–Stokes equation (18.1a) take the form
∇ y p = −ρ0 g0 cos θ,

∇z p = 0.

(18.13)

The solution is clearly p = p0 (x) − ρ0 g0 y cos θ where p0 (x) is an arbitrary function of x. Inserting this
into the x-component of (18.1a) we get,

∇x p0 (x) = g0 sin θ + ν

(18.14)

As in the preceding section it follows that ∇x p0 (x) is a constant, and assuming that there is no pressure
difference between the ends of the plates at x = 0 and x = L x , the pressure itself must be constant,
p0 (x) = p0 . Applying the no-slip boundary conditions, vx (0) = vx (d) = 0, the complete solution
becomes,

where p0 is the pressure on the bottom plate. The pressure is for all θ simply the hydrostatic pressure in a
constant ﬁeld of gravity of strength g0 cos θ. This solution could have been trivially found from the solution
of the preceding section by including the gravitational ﬁeld in the effective pressure p∗ = p + ρ0 such
that G = −d p∗ /d x = ρ0 gx = ρ0 g0 sin θ, but we have refrained from doing so here because it obscures
the physics of the true pressure p (see problem 18.1).

Flow with an open surface
A liquid layer of constant thickness h ﬂowing down an inclined plate with an open surface is another
example of purely gravity-driven ﬂow. On the inclined plate, y = 0, the no-slip condition again demands
vx (0) = 0, whereas on the open surface, y = h, the pressure must be constant and the shear stress must
vanish, dvx /d y = 0. Everything follows along the same lines as above, and we ﬁnd
g sin θ
y(2h − y),
vx = 0
2ν
p = p0 + ρ0 g0 (h − y) cos θ,

(18.16a)
(18.16b)

where p0 is the surface pressure. In retrospect we could have derived it from (18.15) by setting d = 2h,
because the shear stress vanishes for y = d/2 between parallel plates.
The proﬁle is parabolic as before, but now has its maximum at the open surface. The average velocity
is,
U=

(18.17)

The Reynolds number is naturally deﬁned in terms of the layer thickness,
Re =

Uh
.
ν

(18.18)

The maximal velocity is vx |max = (3/2)U , and the total ﬂux in a swath of width W is Q = U hW .
Example 18.3.1 (Water ﬁlm): A water ﬁlm of thickness a = 0.1 mm ﬂows down an inclined plate at
θ = 30 ◦ . The average velocity becomes U = 16 mm s−1 and the Reynolds number Re = 1.6.

∗ Stability of open-surface ﬂow
Most people are familiar with the unstable nature of a layer of liquid ﬂowing down an inclined surface.
Here we shall make a simple estimate which nevertheless captures the correct form of the stability criterion.
The basic idea is to calculate the effective surface tension α created by the liquid layer and determine the
condition under which it is positive. As discussed in section 8.1 a negative real surface tension will make
the surface crumble up, and we shall assume that the same will be the case for the sheet of liquid, such that
the sheet can only be stable for α > 0.
In steady ﬂow the potential energy gained by the downhill ﬂow of the liquid is completely dissipated
into heat by viscous friction, and need not be discussed further. Apart from that, the mechanical energy of
an area A = L × W of the liquid layer is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies,

where the integral has been carried out by means of (18.15).
Using (18.17) this expression may be rewritten in terms of the volume ﬂux Q = U hW and the Reynolds
number Re = Q/νW . After some algebra one arrives at the following expression for the energy

which is most easily veriﬁed by eliminating Q and Re.
To determine the effective surface tension we calculate the change in energy under a change of width
W with the volume ﬂux Q and the length L held constant. In that case only the terms in parenthesis depend
on the width W of the liquid layer through the Reynolds number Re = Q/νW . In this way we obtain the
effective surface tension,

vertical ﬂow (θ = 90 ◦ ) with an open surface is never stable. For the thin water ﬁlm in example 18.3.1 we
have Re tan θ = 0.94 and the ﬁlm will be stable.

18.4 Pipe ﬂow
Cylindrical pipes carrying effectively incompressible ﬂuids are ubiquitous, in industry, in the home and
in our own bodies. Household water and almost all other ﬂuids are transported under pressure in long
pipes with circular cross sections. The question of how much ﬂuid a given pressure can drive through a
circular tube is one of the most basic problems in ﬂuid mechanics and was ﬁrst addressed quantitatively by
Poiseuille around 1841 (and unbeknown to the physics community at that time, independently by Hagen in
1839)3 . Today Poiseuille ﬂow is often used to denote any pressure-driven laminar ﬂow, for example also
the planar ﬂow between ﬁxed plates discussed in section 18.2.
An inﬁnitely long circular cylindrical tube is invariant both under translations along its axis and
rotations around it. In a coordinate system with the z-axis running along the cylinder axis, a ﬂow pattern
respecting this symmetry is,

General solution
The analysis follows along the same lines as for planar ﬂow in section 18.2. The streamlines are all
parallel with the cylinder axis, implying that the assumed ﬁeld (18.23) must be free of divergence,
∇ · v = ∇z (vz (r )ez ) = 0. Similarly, the advective acceleration also vanishes for the same reason,
(v · ∇)v = vz (r ) ∇z (vz (r )ez ) = 0. In the absence of gravity, the Navier–Stokes equation (18.1a) now
simpliﬁes to,
∇ p = η ez ∇ 2 vz (r ).

Poiseuille solution
Consider now a pipe with inner radius a . The ﬂuid velocity cannot be inﬁnite at r = 0, and consequently we
must have A = 0 in the general solution (18.25). The no-slip boundary condition requires that vz (a) = 0,
and this ﬁxes the last integration constant to B = Ga 2 /4η, so that the velocity proﬁle becomes,

immediately be calculated by integrating the velocity ﬁeld over the cross section of the pipe,

(18.28)

This is the famous Hagen–Poiseuille law (see footnote on page 250). As could have been expected, the
throughput grows linearly with the pressure gradient, and inversely with viscosity. The dramatic fourthpower growth with radius could of course have been deduced from dimensional arguments since it is the
only missing factor. It expresses that with growing radius the friction from the walls becomes less and less
important in holding back the ﬂuid.

discharge,

(18.29)

It is exactly half the maximal velocity found at the centre of the pipe.

acceleration vanishes, but usually the Reynolds number is deﬁned as,
Re =

ν
4η

(18.30)

The choice of the pipe diameter d = 2a as length scale is purely a matter of convention. Reynolds himself
actually used the radius [75, p. 85].
Empirically, pipe ﬂow remains laminar until turbulence sets in (see section 18.5). Typically the
transition happens at a Reynolds number between 2000 and 4000, with 2300 as a ‘nominal’ value for
smooth pipes. At that point the otherwise linear relationship between volume discharge Q and pressure
gradient G becomes nonlinear.
Example 18.4.1 (Aortic ﬂow): Human blood is not a particularly Newtonian ﬂuid, but its viscosity
may approximatively be taken to be η = 2.7 × 10−3 Pa s and its density near that of water. The

252

18. PLATES AND PIPES
blood ﬂow rate in the aorta (averaged over a heartbeat) is about Q ≈ 70 cm3 s−1 . Since the diameter
of the aorta is 2a ≈ 35 mm the average velocity becomes U ≈ 7.3 cm s−1 and the Reynolds
number Re ≈ 940, well below the turbulent region. The pressure gradient becomes G ≈ 5 Pa m−1 ,
showing that the pressure drop is negligible in the large arteries compared to systolic blood pressure,
p ≈ 120 mmHg ≈ 16 000 Pa.

Example 18.4.2 (Water pipe): Household water supply has to reach the highest ﬂoor in apartment
buildings with pressure ‘to spare’. Pressures must therefore be of the order of bars when water is
not tapped. The typical discharge rate from a kitchen faucet is around Q ≈ 100 cm3 s−1 , leading
to an average velocity in a half-inch pipe of about U ≈ 0.8 m s−1 . The Reynolds number is about
Re ≈ 10 000 which is well inside the turbulent regime. The pressure gradient calculated from the
Hagen–Poiseuille law, G ≈ 160 Pa m−1 , is for this reason untrustworthy.

Example 18.4.3 (Hypodermic syringe): A hypodermic syringe has a cylindrical chamber with a
diameter of about 2b = 1 cm and a hollow needle with an internal diameter of about 2a = 0.5 mm.
During an injection, about 5 cm3 of the liquid (here assumed to be water) is gently pressed through the
needle in a time of t = 10 s, such that the volume rate is about Q = 0.5 cm3 s−1 .
The average ﬂuid velocity in the needle becomes U ≈ 2.5 m s−1 , corresponding to a Reynolds
number Re ≈ 1300, which is in the laminar region somewhat below the onset of turbulence. One is
thus justiﬁed in using the Poiseuille solution for the ﬂow through the needle. The pressure gradient
necessary to drive this ﬂow is found from (18.29) and becomes rather large, G ≈ 3.3 bar m−1 . For a
needle of length L ≈ 5 cm the pressure drop is p ≈ 0.16 bar = 16 000 Pa. The pressure drop in the
ﬂuid chamber can be completely ignored, because the chamber’s diameter is 20 times that of the needle.

Ostwald viscometer
The Hagen–Poiseuille law (18.28) may be used experimentally to determine the viscosity of a ﬂuid from a
measurement of the pressure drop p = G L and the total volume V = Q t of ﬂuid discharged from
the pipe in the time interval t. The simplest way to create a precisely deﬁned effective pressure drop
is to place the pipe vertically in the gravitational ﬁeld, such that the effective pressure gradient becomes
G = ρ0 g0 . Inserting this into (18.28) we ﬁnd the kinematic viscosity

The Ostwald viscometer is made entirely from glass with no moving parts, and one obtains the kinematic
viscosity of a liquid by measuring the passage time for a known volume of liquid through a narrow section
of pipe.
The viscosity determined in this way is only meaningful for laminar ﬂow which requires the Reynolds
number to be smaller than about 2000. From (18.30) we obtain the Reynolds number for the viscometer,

and this shows that for water-like liquids with ν ≈ 10−6 m2 s−1 the tube radius must be smaller than 1 mm
in order to avoid turbulence.

The pressure drop, p = G L, necessary to drive a given mass ﬂux ρ0 Q through a section of a pipe is
completely analogous to the voltage drop necessary to drive an electric current through a conducting wire.

It depends only on the kinematic viscosity ν of the ﬂuid and the dimensions of the pipe and is measured in
the strange unit m−1 s−1 . Like electric resistance, pipe resistance is additive for pipes connected in series
and reciprocally additive for pipes connected in parallel (see problem 18.10).

Drag
The ﬂuid only interacts with the pipe at its surface r = a and attempts to drag it along with a total force or
drag along z . Using the Poiseuille velocity proﬁle (18.26) the shear wall stress on the pipe becomes,
1

Multiplying with the area 2π aL of the inner pipe surface the drag becomes
σwall = − σzr |r=a = − η∇r vz (r )|r=a =

(18.34)

(18.35)

The linear growth of drag with velocity is characteristic of laminar ﬂow at Reynolds numbers below unity
(see chapter 19). At Reynolds numbers above unity the nonlinear effects of the advective acceleration ought
to set in, but due to the simple geometry of pipe ﬂow the nonlinearity ﬁrst shows up when turbulence sets
in at Re 2000.
In steady ﬂow the amount of momentum of the ﬂuid in the pipe is constant, and consequently the
total force on the volume must vanish. Besides the drag − from the inner pipe surface, the only other
= π a 2 p due to the
force acting on the volume of ﬂuid in the pipe is the external pressure force
difference in pressure between the ends of the volume, and this force must therefore equal the drag,
= . Using the Poiseuille relation (18.29) we may verify that the forces indeed balance each other:
= π a 2 p = π a 2 LG = 8πηU L = .

Example 18.4.3 (Hypodermic syringe, continued): To overcome the pressure drop in the hypodermic
needle, one must act with a force of about
= π b2 p ≈ 1.3 N on the piston, corresponding to the
weight of about 130 g. To this force must be added the force arising from the solid friction between the
piston and the wall of the ﬂuid chamber.

Dissipation
The rate of work (or power) of the external pressure forces acting on the ﬂuid is easily calculated because
the pressure is constant across the pipe. Multiplying = π a 2 p by the average velocity U we obtain,
˙
W = π a 2 p U = Q p = 8πηU 2 L .

(18.36)

The shear stress of the ﬂuid on the pipe wall performs no work because the no-slip condition requires the
velocity ﬁeld to vanish at the wall. In steady ﬂow the kinetic energy of the ﬂuid in the pipe is constant, so
the rate of work of the pressure forces must be exactly equal to the rate of kinetic energy loss to internal
˙
friction forces in the ﬂuid, which is the same as the total power P = W dissipated into heat. A direct
calculation of the dissipated power (17.18) conﬁrms this claim (see problem 18.23).
The average rate of dissipation per unit of ﬂuid mass M = πa 2 Lρ0 in the pipe is an important
parameter, called the average speciﬁc rate of dissipation, which may be calculated from the total rate of

Dissipation does not, however, take place uniformly across the pipe volume but is by far the largest at the
inner pipe surface where the velocity gradient is largest (see problem 18.23). In chapter 32 we shall see that
the speciﬁc rate of dissipation plays a major role in the theory of turbulence.

Example 18.4.3 (Hypodermic syringe, continued): In the hypodermic syringe, the piston velocity is
U0 = Q/πb2 ≈ 0.6 cm s−1 such that the rate of work on the piston is P = U0 = Q p ≈ 8 mW,
corresponding to an average speciﬁc rate of dissipation ε = 830 W kg−1 . Assuming that the
ﬂuid is heated uniformly (which it isn’t) and taking the speciﬁc heat capacity to be that of water
c p = 4.2 × 103 J K−1 kg−1 , this dissipation would raise the temperature of the ﬂuid passing through
the needle by merely T ≈ P/(c p ρU ) ≈ 4 mK.

Sketch of the expected shape of
the velocity proﬁle at various
distances downstream from the
entrance. The inﬂuence of the
wall is indicated by the dashed
lines.

The Poiseuille velocity proﬁle is not established immediately at the entrance to a pipe of ﬁnite length. The
friction exerted on the ﬂuid from the pipe wall will take some time to slow the ﬂuid near the wall, but
eventually the inﬂuence of the wall reaches all the way to the centre of the pipe. Although it is difﬁcult to
make an analytic calculation, we may estimate how far down the pipe the inﬂuence of the entrance can be
felt. In chapter 21 we shall calculate the entrance length numerically for pressure-driven planar ﬂow.
At the entrance proper the ﬂow is assumed to be plug ﬂow with the same velocity U over the pipe cross
section. Close to the pipe wall, where the velocity must vanish, momentum is removed from the ﬂuid by
√
diffusion. As discussed on page 233 the diffusion front moves the distance 2 νt in the time t, so that in the
time t = a 2 /4ν the diffusion front will reach the centre of the pipe, and the average ﬂow will have moved a
distance = U t = U a 2 /4ν downstream from the entrance. Identifying with the entrance length we ﬁnd,

Returning to Torricelli’s law for the draining of a cistern (page 210), we are now able to take into account
the slowing down of the ﬂow due to viscosity. For simplicity we imagine that the liquid level in the cistern
is kept constant by replenishing the cistern with the same amount of ﬂuid as exits from the pipe. In this case
we use energy conservation to calculate the average velocity.
The rate at which work is performed against gravity in moving the ﬂuid from the exit level to the cistern
level is,

18.5 Phenomenology of turbulent pipe ﬂow
Osborne Reynolds was in 1883 the ﬁrst to investigate the nature of turbulent pipe ﬂow. Empirically, laminar
ﬂow is only possible up to a certain value of the Reynolds number, beyond which turbulence sets in.
Before turbulence is fully developed there is, however, ﬁrst a transition region characterized by intermittent
behaviour. After turbulence has become fully established the ﬂow goes for increasing Reynolds number
through at least two distinct stages where different physical processes dominate the character of the ﬂow.
Although to this day there is no established theory of turbulent pipe ﬂow, there exist efﬁcient semiempirical
expressions for the general behaviour as a function of the Reynolds number.

Average velocity and Reynolds number
In what is customarily called ‘fully developed turbulence’ the true velocity ﬁeld varies rapidly in time as
well as from place to place throughout the tube. If dye is injected into the ﬂuid, it quickly spreads through
the whole volume, quite different from laminar ﬂow where it makes orderly streaks.
The volumetric discharge rate Q is nevertheless expected to be relatively steady in turbulent ﬂow, albeit
with some ﬂuctuations. The average velocity calculated from the discharge rate,
U=

Q
,
πa 2

(18.44)

is thus a measure of the rate at which the turbulent ﬂuid progresses down the pipe. As for laminar ﬂow, the
Reynolds number is deﬁned by
Re =

2aU
,
ν

(18.45)

with a conventional factor 2. It is important to realize that independent of the character of the ﬂow, the
discharge rate Q—and therefore U and Re—are experimentally easy to determine by measuring the volume
of ﬂuid discharged from the pipe over a sufﬁciently long time interval.
Empirically, turbulence sets in around Re ≈ 2000–4000, depending on the conditions under which
this region is approached, with the ‘nominal’ value being 2300. For a smooth pipe under very carefully
controlled conditions, the transition to turbulence can in fact be delayed until a Reynolds number of the
order of 100 000. Above that value, the ﬂow is so sensitive to disturbances that it becomes practically
impossible to avoid turbulence, even if the Poiseuille solution is believed to be stable towards inﬁnitesimal
perturbations (in the r z-plane) for all Reynolds numbers4 .

Friction factor
Intuitively, one expects that turbulence causes increased resistance to the ﬂow and therefore requires a
larger pressure drop p than laminar ﬂow to obtain the same rate of discharge Q under steady conditions.
= πa 2 p, and is
The drag is as before determined from the pressure drop by the balance of forces,
accordingly also expected to be larger than the laminar expression (18.35). Since the Reynolds number is
the only dimensionless quantity that may be constructed from the average velocity (problem 18.9), we may
always write the drag as the laminar expression times a dimensionless friction factor f (Re), depending
only on the Reynolds number,
= 8πηU L f (Re).

(18.46)

The friction factor is evidently anchored with the value f (Re) = 1 in laminar ﬂow, and as we shall see
below it grows monotonically with the Reynolds number in the turbulent region, although in the transition
to turbulence it is not too well deﬁned because of intermittent shifts between laminar and turbulent ﬂow.

In the technical literature C f is sometimes called the Fanning friction factor, and often one also meets the
Darcy friction factor which equals 4C f .
It is a matter of taste whether to use the friction coefﬁcient C f (Re) or the friction factor f (Re). For
fairly low Reynolds numbers the friction factor is the most natural choice, because it is anchored in the
laminar region. The friction coefﬁcient on the other hand tends to become constant for inﬁnite Reynolds
number, except for perfectly smooth pipes. It is thus anchored in the region of extremely turbulent ﬂow, but
its limiting value C f (∞) depends on the roughness of the pipe surface.

18.5. PHENOMENOLOGY OF TURBULENT PIPE FLOW

257

Smooth pipe case
For a perfectly smooth inner pipe surface a decent semiempirical approximation was given by Blasius in
1911, in which the friction coefﬁcient decreases slowly as the −1/4 power of the Reynolds number, while
the friction factor increases as the 3/4 power,
C f ≈ 0.079Re−1/4 ,

f ≈ 0.0049Re3/4 .

(18.50)

Turbulence theory (chapter 32) produces a more complicated expression for C f which agrees numerically
with the above expression in the interval 4000 Re 100 000.
One may wonder whether the smooth pipe expression has any relevance except for glass pipes that are
in fact quite smooth. Industrially produced pipes are typically made from rubber, plastic, iron or concrete
with different degrees of inner surface roughness. But it turns out that any not too irregular surface will tend
to behave approximately like a perfectly smooth surface in some range of Reynolds numbers beyond the
transition to turbulence. The reason is that when turbulence sets in, the no-slip condition still requires the
ﬂuid velocity to vanish at a solid wall. This leads to the formation of viscous wall layers which screen the
bulk of the ﬂow from the inﬂuence of the surface roughness, thus making the surface appear to be smooth.
The wall layers, however, become thinner and the screening less effective for very high Reynolds numbers.
100 000, the smooth pipe approximation
Above a certain roughness-dependent value, typically for Re
generally loses its usefulness.

Example 18.5.1 (Water pipe): A quite normal use of household water was shown in example 18.4.2
to lead to a Reynolds number of about Re ≈ 10 000, which is well inside the turbulent regime,
though not in the rough pipe region. From the smooth pipe formula (18.50) we ﬁnd the friction factor
f (10 000) = 5. The pressure gradient must therefore be 5 times larger than the Hagen–Poiseuille value
(which is 160 Pa m−1 ), or G ≈ 800 Pa m−1 . Drag and dissipation are similarly augmented.
Turbulence makes the pipes hiss or ‘sing’ when you tap water at full speed, though most of the
noise probably comes from the narrow passages of the faucet, where the water speed and Reynolds
number are highest, and the big drop from main to atmospheric pressure takes place.

Rough pipe limit
At sufﬁciently high Reynolds number the irregular turbulent ﬂow is caused by the ﬂuid literally slamming
into the small protrusions of the rough pipe surface, rather than by the viscous friction. In this limit the drag
becomes independent of the actual viscosity, even if it in the end must owe its very existence to viscosity!
Correspondingly, the friction coefﬁcient becomes a constant, C f (∞) = limRe→∞ C f (Re), which depends
on the character of the rough surface.
The surface roughness may be characterized by the average height k of the surface irregularities, a
parameter that depends on the material of the pipe and how it is produced. A decent semi-empirical
expression for the limiting friction coefﬁcient is also given by a power law,

The calculation of the turbulent drain velocity proceeds in much the same way as for laminar viscous ﬂow
(page 254), except that we do not know the actual velocity distribution in the pipe. Although there will also
be boundary layers in turbulent pipe ﬂow, we shall for simplicity assume that the bulk of the turbulent ﬂow
proceeds through the pipe as a turbulent plug with roughly the same average speed across the pipe.

long pipes with 4C f (∞) L/2a

elongated this will eventually bring the Reynolds number down into the smooth pipe and laminar regions.
Example 18.5.3 (Barrel of wine, continued): For the barrel of wine (example 16.3.2 on page 211)
which empties through a wooden spout of length L = 20 cm and diameter 2a = 5 cm the Reynolds
number is about 300 000, well into the rough pipe region. Disregarding entry corrections and assuming
a wood roughness of k ≈ 0.5 mm, corresponding to k/2a = 0.01, we ﬁnd C f (∞) ≈ 10−2 and
4C f (∞)L/2a ≈ 0.16. The Toricelli value for the exit velocity is thus only reduced by about 8% by
turbulence.

18.6 Circulating cylindrical ﬂow
In cylindrical geometry there is another exact solution with maximal symmetry, in which the ﬂuid circles
around the cylinder axis with a velocity ﬁeld of the form,
v = vφ (r )eφ ,

(18.56)

where eφ is the tangential unit vector in cylindrical coordinates (see appendix B). The ﬁeld lines are
concentric circles, and the ﬁeld is also in this case invariant under rotation around the cylinder axis and
translation along it.

the cylindrical basis. This is in agreement with the elementary observation that streamlines neither diverge

most be linear in φ, i.e. of the form p = p0 (r ) + p1 (r )φ. But here we must require p1 = 0, for otherwise
the pressure would have different values for φ = 0 and φ = 2π, and that is impossible. For this reason the
pressure cannot depend on φ but only on r , and thus it disappears completely from (18.60b).

Couette ﬂow between rotating cylinders
Suppose the ﬂuid is contained between two long coaxial material cylinders with the innermost having radius
a and outermost radius b > a. This problem was solved by Couette (1890), but today Couette ﬂow is often
used to denote any kind of motion-driven laminar ﬂow, for example also laminar channel ﬂow between
moving parallel plates (p. 232).
Here we shall for simplicity only study the case where the outer cylinder is held ﬁxed and the inner
cylinder rotates like a spindle with constant angular velocity . The boundary conditions, vφ (a) = a and
vφ (b) = 0, then determine A and B, so the velocity proﬁle becomes

The angular momentum of the
ﬂuid between the two cylinder
surfaces is constant, which implies that the total moment of
force on the ﬂuid must vanish.

(18.66)

It represents the friction between the layers of circulating ﬂuid, and the sign is negative because the ﬂuid
outside the radius r acts as a brake on the motion of the ﬂuid inside (which has normal er ).
In order to maintain the steady rotation of the inner cylinder it is necessary to act on it with a moment
of force or torque Åz (and with an opposite moment at the outer cylinder). Multiplying the shear stress
with the moment arm r and the area 2πr L of the cylinder at r , we ﬁnally obtain the torque with which the
ﬂuid inside r acts on the ﬂuid outside,

(18.67)

We could have foreseen that it would be independent of r from angular momentum conservation. In steady
ﬂow the total angular momentum of the ﬂuid between any two cylindrical surfaces is constant and there is
no transport through the cylindrical surfaces because they are orthogonal to the velocity. Consequently the
total moment of force has to vanish, implying that the moments of shear stress acting on the two cylindrical
surfaces must be equal.
The rate of work that must be done against the friction from the ﬂuid to keep the inner cylinder rotating
is obtained by multiplying the stress −σφr with the velocity r and the area of the cylinder,
P = (−σφr ) r

(18.68)

Since the kinetic energy of the ﬂuid is constant in steady ﬂow and since no ﬂuid enters or leaves the system,
this must equal the rate of energy dissipation in the ﬂuid.

18.6. CIRCULATING CYLINDRICAL FLOW

261

Couette viscometer: In the Couette viscometer the viscosity of the ﬂuid is determined from the
extra motor power necessary to drive the inner cylinder at constant angular velocity. A more stable
arrangement (see page 264) consists of hanging the inner cylinder by a torsion wire and rotating
the outer cylinder at constant angular velocity. When the chamber is ﬁlled with viscous ﬂuid there
will arise a torque on the inner cylinder, which is counteracted by the torsion in the wire so that
at equilibrium a certain deﬂection angle is obtained. Measuring the deﬂection angle then leads to
a value for the viscosity (problem 18.20). The torsional rigidity (page 157) of the wire may be
determined from the period of free oscillations of the inner cylinder when the chamber is empty.

Unloaded journal bearing
In a lubricated journal bearing a liquid, say oil, is trapped in a tiny gap between a rotating shaft (or journal)
and its bearing (or bushing). Normally such systems carry a load which brings the shaft off-centre (see
section 27.4) but here we shall assume that the journal and its bushing are concentric cylinders, such that
we may apply the Couette formalism in the limit of very small distance d = b − a
a between the
cylinders.
To lowest order in d and the distance s = r − a from the shaft, we ﬁnd,
vφ =

a 1−

s
.
d

(18.69)

The velocity ﬁeld is linear in s, just as for planar Couette ﬂow. This is not particularly surprising since the
tiny gap between the cylinders looks very much like the gap between parallel plates. The natural deﬁnition
of the Reynolds number is correspondingly,
Re =

²

ad
,
ν

(18.70)

and we expect turbulence to arise for Re 2000, as in the planar case.
The pressure is found from (18.64) by expanding the logarithm to third order in s and d, and it becomes
in the leading approximation,
s 3
1
.
p = p0 − ad 2 1 −
3
d

(18.71)

The pressure variation across the gap is proportional to the size d of the gap and thus normally tiny, unless
the quadratic growth with angular velocity overwhelms it. The dissipation becomes on the other hand (to
lowest order in d),
P=

2πη 2 a 3 L
.
d

(18.72)

It is inversely proportional to the thickness of the layer of ﬂuid and grows, like the pressure variation,
quadratically with the angular velocity. This is why even a lubricated bearing may burst into ﬂames at
sufﬁciently high rotation speed.
Example 18.6.1 (Burning bush): Consider a vertical wooden shaft in a wooden bushing with diameter
2a = 10 cm, such as could have been used in an old water mill. Let the gap be d = 1 mm and let the
lubricant be heavy grease with η ≈ 10 Pa s, corresponding to ν ≈ 0.01 m2 s−1 . The power dissipated
per unit of lubricant volume is
P
η 2 a2
.
=
2πaLd
d2

(18.73)

For a modest speed of one rotation per second, ≈ 2π s −1 with a Reynolds number of Re ≈ 0.06, this
comes to about 1 J cm−3 s−1 . If the mill rotates 10 times faster because of torrential rains, this number
becomes instead 100 J cm−3 s−1 with a Reynolds number of 0.6. Since wood is a bad heat conductor,
the grease may ignite in a matter of minutes even taking into account that its viscosity decreases with
temperature.

Spindle-driven vortex
Suppose a long cylindrical spindle of radius a is inserted into an inﬁnite sea of ﬂuid, and that the spindle is
rotated steadily with constant angular velocity . Provided the spindle does not rotate so fast that it creates
turbulence, the ﬂow will eventually become steady with an azimuthal velocity ﬁeld that may be found from
the Couette solution with b → ∞,

If the ﬂuid is a nearly ideal liquid, the true pressure at an open surface must equal the (constant) air pressure

following shape of the surface,

(18.76)

This is quite different from the parabolic shape of the liquid surface in a rotating bucket (page 87).

Open liquid surface of a spindledriven vortex in constant gravity
varies like 1/r 2 .

Example 18.6.2: A spindle with radius a = 1 cm making 10 turns per second, corresponding to
= 63 s−1 , would make a depression in the liquid surface, d = L − h(a) ≈ 2 cm, at the spindle.
The rule about continuity of pressure across any surface is only strictly valid in hydrostatics (in the
absence of surface tension), whereas in hydrodynamics it is instead the full stress vector that has to vanish
at the open surface. For the spindle-driven vortex the non-vanishing stresses are
σφr = −2η

a2
,
r2

σrr = σzz = σφφ = − p.

(18.77)

Whereas the diagonal stresses vanish at the surface (18.76), the shear stress is always non-zero. Strictly
speaking the above solution only describes a vortex with an open surface in the limit of vanishing viscosity.
Unfortunately we encounter another problem in this limit, because without viscosity it is impossible to
crank up the vortex from a ﬂuid at rest. The structure of driven as well as free vortices will be analysed in
detail in chapter 26.

∗ 18.7 Secondary ﬂow and Taylor vortices
Real machinery cannot be inﬁnite in any direction. Suppose the cylinders are capped with plates ﬁxed to the
outer non-rotating cylinder so that only the inner cylinder rotates. The no-slip condition forces the rotating
ﬂuid to slow down and come to rest not only at the outer cylinder, but also at both the end caps, implying
that the assumption about a simple circulating ﬂow (18.61) with its z-independent azimuthal velocity vφ (r )
cannot be right everywhere. In fact it cannot be right anywhere! Clean Couette ﬂow is like clean Poiseuille
ﬂow an idealization that can only be approximately realized far from the ends of the apparatus. Secondary
ﬂow with non-vanishing radial and longitudinal velocity components, vr and vz , will have to arise near the
container walls in order to satisfy the no-slip boundary conditions at the end caps.

Direction of secondary ﬂow
We shall begin with assuming that the length of the apparatus is comparable to the gap, say L ≈ 2d, and that
the gap is completely ﬁlled with ﬂuid without open surfaces. In the bulk of the ﬂuid, the Couette solution

is still a good approximation, and the main job of the pressure here is to provide centripetal force for the
circulating ﬂuid as shown by the radial gradient (18.60a).
The longitudinal pressure gradient ∇z p determines how rapidly the pressure can vary in the z-direction,
and from the z-component of the full Navier–Stokes equation (18.1a) we obtain (still disregarding gravity)

∇z p = −ρ0 (v · ∇)vz + η∇ 2 vz .
The right-hand side is expected to be small throughout the ﬂuid because the longitudinal velocity vz must
nearly vanish in the Couette bulk ﬂow in the middle of the apparatus and also has to vanish at the bottom
end cap (which the ﬂuid cannot penetrate). The vertical variation in pressure near the bottom is therefore
not able to seriously challenge the large values of the centripetally dominated bulk pressure. The pressure
is for this reason rather ‘stiff’ as we approach the bottom and remains more or less equal to the pressure in
the bulk with only small corrections.
Near the bottom, the still intact bulk pressure will have an inwards directed radial gradient, −∇r p,
capable of delivering the centripetal force to keep the rapidly rotating ﬂuid in the bulk moving in a circle.
But the no-slip condition requires the azimuthal velocity to vanish at the bottom, vφ → 0 for z → 0, so that
2
the actually required centripetal acceleration −vφ /r is much smaller there than in the bulk. As a result, the
combination of the stiff pressure gradient and the smaller centripetal acceleration gives rise to a net force
directed towards the axis, and that force will in turn drive a radial ﬂow inwards along the bottom. The same
argument shows that there must also be an inwards ﬂow along the top and since the moving ﬂuid has to go
somewhere, it tends to form two oppositely rotating ring-shaped (toroidal) vortices that encircle the axis.
If the axis is vertical and the liquid has an open surface, only a single vortex needs to be formed. It
is this kind of secondary ﬂow that drives the tea leaves along the bottom towards the centre of a cup of
tea after stirring it. As the above argument shows the ﬂow is independent of the direction of stirring. You
cannot, for example, make the tea leaves move out again by ‘unstirring’ your tea.

region

Rayleigh’s stability criterion
In the above discussion, the cylinder length was assumed to be comparable to the gap size. For a long
cylinder, the preceding argument seems to indicate that a secondary ﬂow with two highly elongated
‘vortices’ should form which satisfy the boundary conditions on the end caps, or just one if there is an
open surface. Such elongated vortices are, however, unstable and tend to break up in a number of smaller
and more circular vortices.
The instability can be understood by an argument analogous to the discussion of atmospheric stability
on page 57. For simplicity we shall, as Rayleigh did, assume that there is no viscosity. Suppose now that
a unit mass ﬂuid particle in the bulk of the rotating ﬂuid is shifted outwards to a larger value of r by a tiny
amount. During the move the ﬂuid particle will conserve its angular momentum and will in general arrive
in its new position with a speed which is different from the ambient speed of the ﬂuid there. The angular
momentum of a unit mass particle in the ambient ﬂuid is r vφ , and depending on how the ﬂuid rotates, it
may grow or decrease with increasing distance. If it is constant, such that d(r vφ )/dr = 0, then the moved
particle ﬁts snugly into its new home with just the right velocity. This is a marginal case, realized by the
spindle-driven vortex (page 262) which has r vφ = a 2 .
In general, however, the angular momentum r vφ of a unit mass particle in the ambient ﬂuid will not
be a constant. If it locally grows in magnitude with distance, then a ﬂuid particle displaced to a slightly
larger radius will arrive with its original angular momentum and thus have a smaller velocity than its new
surroundings. The inward pressure gradient in the ambient ﬂuid will therefore be larger than required to
keep the particle in a circular orbit with lower velocity, and it will be forced back to where it came from.
This is Rayleigh’s stability criterion,
d r vφ
> 0.
dr

(18.78)

The stability criterion will trivially be fulﬁlled if the inner cylinder is held ﬁxed and the outer rotated,
because then the azimuthal velocity vφ and thus r vφ must necessarily grow with the radial distance.
Such a situation is perfectly stable. Any little radial ﬂuctuation in the ﬂow is quickly ‘ironed out’ and the
ﬂow remains well-ordered and laminar until turbulence sets in.

Conversely, if the above inequality is not fulﬁlled everywhere, the ﬂow will be unstable and reconﬁgure

(18.79)

which is evidently negative, and more negative the faster the inner cylinder rotates and the narrower the gap.
Viscosity, which has been ignored so far, will delay the onset of instability, but it requires a more careful
analysis to determine the precise criterion (see for example [43, 1, 13, 19]).
For sufﬁciently large angular driving velocity , the Couette ﬂow in a small gap between the rotating
inner and ﬁxed outer cylinder becomes unstable and a string of ring-shaped vortices will arise in the
gap. They are called Taylor vortices in honour of G. I. Taylor who ﬁrst analysed their properties, both
experimentally and theoretically. The Taylor vortices are all mutually counter-rotating and match up with
the sense of ﬂow dictated by the boundary conditions on the ends (for pictures see [5]).
The formation of secondary ﬂow and the instability leading to toroidal (ring-shaped) Taylor vortices
represents a breakdown of the longitudinal symmetry (along z) of the cylinder. The azimuthal symmetry (in
φ) is to begin with maintained but also breaks down with increasing speed of rotation. The regular Taylor
vortices are then replaced by wavy vortices that undulate up and down (in z) while they encircle the axis.
Increasing the speed further will increase the number of undulations until the ﬂow ﬁnally, after an inﬁnity
of such transitions, becomes chaotic and turbulent.

do not make spinning vortices or become turbulent, but rather ooze or creep around obstacles. Fluid ﬂow
which is dominated by viscosity is quite appropriately called creeping ﬂow.
Since there is no absolute meaning to ‘large’ viscosity, creeping ﬂow is more correctly characterized
by the Reynolds number being small, Re
1. Creeping ﬂow may occur in any ﬂuid, as long as the typical
velocity and geometric extent of the ﬂow combine to make a small Reynolds number. Blood ﬂowing
through a microscopic capillary can be as sluggish as heavy oil. Tiny organisms like bacteria live in air
and water like ourselves, but theirs is a world of creeping and oozing rather than whirls and turbulence,
and movement requires special devices, for example oar-like cilia or whip-like ﬂagella [75]. Some bacteria
have even mounted a rotating helical tail in a journal bearing (the only one known to biology), which like a
corkscrew allows them to advance through the thick ﬂuid that they experience water to be. A spermatozoan
pushes forward like a slithering snake in the grass by undulating its tail.
In this chapter we shall study creeping ﬂow around moving bodies far from containing boundaries.
For any creature in creeping ﬂow, the most important quantity is the ﬂuid’s resistance against motion, also
called drag. The drag on a body has two components of comparable magnitude in creeping ﬂow, one being
skin drag from viscous friction between the ﬂuid and the body, and the other form drag from the variations
in ﬂuid pressure across the body. The contact forces may also produce lift orthogonally to the direction of
motion, but in creeping ﬂow far from containing boundaries lift is of the same order of magnitude as drag.
A tiny creature that must already overcome a drag many times its weight in order to move freely has no
problem with ﬂying. That’s why bacteria do not have wings.

19.1 Steady incompressible creeping ﬂow
Leaving out the advective acceleration, we obtain from (18.1) the following equations for steady
incompressible creeping ﬂow, also called Stokes ﬂow,
∇ p = ρ0 g + η∇ 2 v,
∇ · v = 0,

(19.1a)
(19.1b)

valid for Re
1. The divergence of the ﬁrst equation implies that in the absence of gravitational sources,
∇ · g = 0, the pressure must satisfy the Laplace equation,
∇ 2 p = 0.
This is sometimes convenient in practical calculations.

19. CREEPING FLOW
Creeping ﬂow is mathematically (and numerically) much easier to handle than general ﬂow because of
the absence of nonlinear terms that tend to spontaneously break the natural symmetry of the solutions in time
as well as space with turbulence as the extreme result. The linearity of the creeping ﬂow equations allows
us to express solutions to more complicated ﬂow problems as linear superpositions of simpler solutions. We
may for example eliminate the static ﬁeld of gravity by subtracting the hydrostatic pressure −ρ0 from the
actual pressure. In the following we shall assume g = 0, but must at the same time not forget to subtract
the buoyancy force from the weight of an immersed body.

The total reaction force
from
the ﬂuid on the body is composed
of lift and drag .

Consider a body moving with constant velocity U through a static ﬂuid. Cruising along the body creates
a temporary disturbance in the ﬂuid that disappears again some time after the body has passed a ﬁxed
observation point. But seen from the body, the ﬂuid appears to move in a steady pattern which at
sufﬁciently large distances has uniform magnitude U . Newtonian relativity guarantees that these situations
are physically equivalent, so we may use the creeping ﬂow equations (19.1).
The only way the ﬂuid can inﬂuence a solid body is through contact forces acting on its surface. In
all such cases it is convenient to resolve the total contact force from the ﬂuid on the body, also called the
reaction force, into two components,

Ê≡

S

σ · dS =

+

Ä.

(19.3)

The ﬁrst component is called the drag and acts in the direction of the asymptotic ﬂow, whereas the other
is called the lift and acts orthogonally to the direction of asymptotic ﬂow. Thus we have

Ä

=

Ä · eU = 0,

eU ,

(19.4)

where eU = U/U is a unit vector in the direction of the asymptotic velocity.

Estimates
We shall think of the body as roughly potato-shaped with typical diameter L. Since (for g = 0) the pressure
only appears in (19.1) in the combination p/η, and since the no-slip boundary conditions on the surface
of the body do not involve the pressure, the velocity ﬁeld cannot depend on η, but only on the asymptotic
velocity U and on the shape and orientation of the body. The linearity of creeping ﬂow guarantees that the
velocity and pressure must both be proportional to the asymptotic velocity, such that |v| ∼ U and p/η ∼ U .
Skin drag is produced by the viscous shear stresses acting on the surface (skin) of a body. The velocity
gradients near the surface are of magnitude |∇v| ∼ U/L so the magnitude of the shear stress becomes
σ
|σ | ∼ ηU/L. Multiplying by the surface area of the body which is of magnitude L 2 we obtain an estimate,
skin ≈ f skin ηU L ,

(19.5)

with an unknown dimensionless prefactor fskin of order unity. This factor cannot depend on the Reynolds
number but only on the geometry of the body. We may similarly estimate the pressure gradient near the
surface from (19.1) to be |∇ p| ≈ ηU/L 2 , and multiplying with the length L of the body, the pressure
variations over the body become of the same size as the shear stresses, | p| ∼ ηU/L. Multiplying by the
surface area L 2 , the estimate of the form drag takes the same form as skin drag,
form ≈ f form ηU L .

(19.6)

In general, it has another geometric prefactor. The total drag is the sum of skin and form drag, and becomes
of order of magnitude
≈ f drag ηU L ,

(19.7)

with f drag = f skin + f form .
Lift is produced by the same contact forces as drag and is therefore also of this magnitude,

Ä

| | = flift ηU L .

The lift vanishes for a symmetric body like a sphere or cylinder orthogonal to the asymptotic ﬂow, but for
asymmetric bodies the geometric prefactor f lift is normally strongly dependent on the orientation of the
body with respect to the direction of motion.
Note that lift is not necessarily related to the direction of gravity, but can point in any direction
orthogonal to the direction of motion. Near a solid boundary lift can be much larger than drag and may in
fact serve to keep the body away from the boundary. This is the secret behind lubrication, which is taken
up in chapter 27. Lift in nearly ideal ﬂuids (aerodynamic lift) may also be much larger than drag and will
be discussed at length in chapter 29.

19.2 Creeping ﬂow around a solid ball
A solid spherical ball moving at constant speed through a viscous ﬂuid is the centerpiece of steady creeping
ﬂow (Stokes, 1851). The solution may be worked out starting from the ﬁeld equations (19.1) and the
boundary conditions (see problem 19.10), but even if deriving the solution is a bit complicated the result is
fairly simple.

The Stokes solution
In spherical coordinates with polar axis in the direction of the asymptotic ﬂow U, the solution for a sphere
of radius a is (see ﬁgure 19.1),

(19.9d)

Note that the ﬁelds are independent of the azimuthal angle φ and has vφ = 0 as one would expect from
symmetry. The velocity ﬁeld vanishes for r = a and thus fulﬁlls the no-slip boundary condition on the
surface of the sphere. Asymptotically for r → ∞ it becomes vr → U cos θ and vθ → −U sin θ, which is
the expected homogeneous velocity ﬁeld U = ez U .
The pressure is forward-backwards asymmetric, highest on the part of the sphere that turns towards the
incoming ﬂow (at θ = π). This asymmetry is in marked contrast with the potential ﬂow solution (16.74)
where the pressure is symmetric. The ﬂow pattern is independent of the viscosity of the ﬂuid, whereas the
pressure is proportional to η, as expected for creeping ﬂow problems where the boundary conditions do not
involve the pressure.

Stokes law for drag on a sphere
For symmetry reasons the sphere can only be subject to drag. To ﬁnd it we ﬁrst calculate the normal and
shear stress tensor components. Using the standard Newtonian stress tensor, σi j = − pδi j +η(∇i v j +∇ j vi ),
we ﬁnd the radial stress

Figure 19.1. Creeping ﬂow around a unit sphere with only the upper half shown. Streamlines have been
obtained by numeric integration of equation (15.2) starting equidistantly at z = −100 to avoid problems
of long-range terms (see problem 19.7 for how to obtain the streamlines in an efﬁcient way). The pressure
vanishes at the dashed line. Note how this pattern is qualitatively different from the potential ﬂow pattern
shown in ﬁgure 16.5 with the inﬂuence of the sphere stretching much farther.

Surprisingly, it is of constant magnitude and across the entire surface points in the direction of the
asymptotic ﬂow.
Due to this result, the total reaction force is simply obtained by multiplying the constant stress vector
by the area 4πa 2 of the sphere. Since the force is proportional to U, it is a pure drag,
σ r |r=a = er σrr + eθ σθr =

= 6πηaU.

(19.12)

This is the famous Stokes law from 1851. The symmetry of the sphere could have told us in advance that
there would be no lift, because there is no other global direction than U deﬁned for the problem. Taking
L = 2a to represent the size of the sphere, this form of the drag was already predicted in (19.7) with a
geometric prefactor f drag = 3π. In problem 19.5 it is shown that 2/3 of the total is skin drag and 1/3 is
form drag.

Although Stokes law has been derived in the rest system of the sphere, it is also valid in the rest system
of the asymptotic ﬂuid, because forces are invariant under translation with constant velocity. The terminal
velocity of a falling solid sphere may be obtained by equating the force of gravity (minus buoyancy) with
the Stokes drag,

where ν = η/ρ0 is the kinematic viscosity.
Example 19.2.1 (Sedimentation): Sand grains of diameter 0.1 mm and density 2.5 times that of water
ﬂoat towards the bottom of the sea with a terminal velocity of 0.8 cm s−1 , as calculated from Stokes’
law. The corresponding Reynolds number is about 0.8, which is at the limit of the region of validity of
Stokes’ law.
Conversely, in the falling sphere viscometer, equation (19.14) may be used to determine the viscosity
ν from a measurement of the terminal velocity for a sphere of known radius and density. One may also,
as Millikan did in his famous electron charge experiments (1909–1913), determine the radius of a falling
sphere (an oil drop) from a measurement of the terminal velocity, provided the viscosity of the ﬂuid is
known (it was actually necessary to include corrections to Stokes law for the internal motion of the oil in
the tiny drops). In Millikan’s experiment the oil drops were charged and could be made to hover, rise or fall
in the ﬁeld of gravity as slowly as desired by means of an electric ﬁeld of suitable strength. Knowing the
radius, the electric force on an oil drop could be compared to gravity, allowing the charge to be determined1 .
Stokes law has been derived under the assumption of creeping ﬂow, which can only be valid under the
condition that the Reynolds number
ρ 2aU
Re = 0
η

(19.15)

is small compared to unity, Re
1. For a falling sphere where the terminal velocity is determined from
the balance of forces (19.13), the Reynolds number varies as the third power of the radius. As long as the
sphere is sufﬁciently small, the conditions for creeping ﬂow can always be fulﬁlled.

Limits to Stokes ﬂow
The Reynolds number (19.15) is, however, only a rough estimate for the ratio between advective and viscous
terms in the Navier–Stokes equations for a particular geometry. Having obtained an explicit solution we
may actually calculate this ratio throughout the ﬂuid to see if it is indeed small.
Close to the sphere, the velocity is very small because of the no-slip condition. Problems are only
expected to arise at large distances, where the leading corrections to the uniform ﬂow are provided by the
a/r terms in the solution (19.9). Disregarding the angular dependence, the leading advective terms are at
large distances,
a
(19.16)
|ρ0 v · ∇v| ∼ ρ0 U 2 2 ,
r
whereas the viscous terms become,
a
(19.17)
|η∇ 2 v| ∼ ηU 3 .
r
The actual ratio between advective and viscous terms is then,
|ρ0 v · ∇v|
|η∇ 2 v|

ρ Ur
r
∼ 0
∼ Re
η
a

(19.18)

where Re is the global Reynolds number (19.15). As this expression grows with r , we conclude that however
a/Re where the advective force
small the Reynolds number may be, there will always be a distance r
begins to dominate the viscous. This clearly illustrates that the global Reynolds number is just a guideline,
not a guarantee that creeping ﬂow will occur everywhere in a system. Since any ﬁnite potato-like body at
sufﬁciently large distances looks like a sphere, this problem must in fact be present in all creeping ﬂows.
The slowly decreasing a/r terms in the Stokes solution (19.9) also indicate the inﬂuence of the
containing vessel. The relative magnitude of these terms at the boundary of the vessel is estimated as
2a/D where D is the size (diameter) of the vessel. In the falling sphere viscometer a 1% measurement of
viscosity thus requires that the sphere diameter must be smaller than 1% of the vessel size. That can be hard
to fulﬁl in highly viscous ﬂuids where a measurable terminal speed demands rather large and heavy spheres.

1 The viscosity of air used in Millikan’s experiment was determined by Couette viscometer measurements (see p. 260).
At that time, there was actually a systematic error of about 0.5% in the viscosity of air deriving mainly from the failure
to take into account the end caps of the Couette viscometer, an error ﬁrst corrected more than 20 years later (see, for
example J. A. Bearden, Phys. Rev. 56, (1939) 1023).

ﬁgure 19.1, this is not creeping ﬂow and the friction factor is somewhat larger than unity. Reproduced from
S. Tanada J. Phys. Soc. Jpn 46 (1979) 1935–42.

19.3 Beyond Stokes’ law
Stokes law has been derived in the limit of vanishing Reynolds number (19.15), and is empirically valid
for Re 1. For larger values of Re the simplicity of the problem nevertheless allows us to make a general
analysis, as we did for turbulent pipe ﬂow (section 18.5 on page 255), even if we cannot solve the Navier–
Stokes equations explicitly.

º

Friction factor
Since the only parameters deﬁning the problem are the radius a, the velocity U , the viscosity η and the
density of the ﬂuid ρ, we may for any Reynolds number write the drag on the sphere in the form of the
Stokes law multiplied by a dimensionless factor f (Re),
= 6πηaU f (Re).

(19.19)

This factor accounts for the deviations from Stokes law and is evidently anchored at unity for vanishing
Reynolds number, i.e. f (0) = 1. As for pipe ﬂow we shall call it the friction factor, although as mentioned
above only 2/3 of the drag on the sphere is in fact due to friction and 1/3 to the front-to-back pressure
asymmetry (problem 19.5).

Drag coefﬁcient
In the opposite limit at large Reynolds number Re
1, far beyond the creeping ﬂow region, the sphere
literally plows its way through the ﬂuid, leaving a wake of highly disturbed and turbulent ﬂuid. The
drag may, for example, be estimated from the rate of loss of momentum from the incoming ﬂuid that
is disturbed by the sphere. The incoming ﬂuid carries a momentum density ρ0 U and since the sphere
presents a cross-sectional area πa 2 to the ﬂow, the rate at which momentum impinges on the sphere is
ρ0 U · πa 2 U = ρ0 πa 2 U 2 . Alternatively, the scale of the drag may be obtained from the stagnation pressure
increase, p = (1/2)ρ0 U 2 , times the cross-section area πa 2 .
The drag at high Reynolds numbers is thus expected to grow with the square of the velocity (at subsonic
speeds). But the ﬂuid in the wake trailing the sphere is not completely at rest, such that only a certain

(the ‘drag crisis’) at Re = 2.5× 105 signals the onset of turbulence in the boundary layer on the front half of
the sphere and an accompanying shift in the shape of the trailing wake. After the drop the drag coefﬁcient
rises again. The terminal value of the drag coefﬁcient and the Reynolds number for the onset of the drag
crisis both increase with increasing Mach number. For Mach numbers above 0.8 there is no drag crisis [61,
p. 12].
fraction of the incoming momentum will be lost. It is for this reason customary to deﬁne the dimensionless
drag coefﬁcient
CD =

(1/2)ρ0 π a 2 U 2

,

(19.20)

with a conventional factor 1/2 in the denominator, perhaps inspired by the form of the stagnation pressure.
Empirically, the drag coefﬁcient for a sphere is C D ≈ 0.5 in the interval 104 Re 2.5 × 105 , implying
that about 25% of the incoming ﬂuid momentum is lost to drag.
Inserting the deﬁnition of the friction factor for a sphere (19.19) we ﬁnd

º

(19.21)

for all Reynolds numbers. It is a matter of taste whether one prefers to describe the drag on a sphere by
means of the drag coefﬁcient or the friction factor. At small Reynolds numbers, it seems a bit pointless
to use the drag coefﬁcient, because it introduces a strong artiﬁcial variation C D ≈ 24/Re for Re → 0
without a corresponding strong variation in the physics (which is simply described by Stokes law). At
large Reynolds numbers the drag coefﬁcient becomes a constant, which is more convenient to use than the
linearly rising friction factor, although its value depends on the roughness of the ball surface.

The ﬁrst term is Stokes’ result and the last is a constant terminal form drag. The middle term may be
understood as due to friction in a thin laminar boundary layer (see chapter 28) on the forward half of the
sphere. There are a number of different formulae in the literature covering the same empirical data. As seen
in ﬁgure 19.3, this formula agrees decently with data for all Reynolds numbers up to Re ≈ 104 , where the
drag coefﬁcient ﬁrst rises to about 0.5. Above Re ≈ 2.5 × 105 the drag coefﬁcient drops sharply by more
than a factor 2, after which it begins to rise again, a phenomenon called the ‘drag crisis’.

The drag crisis
Alexandre-Gustave Eiffel (1832–
1923). French structural engineer. Famous for building the
Eiffel tower in Paris. Worked
on aerodynamics for the last 21
years of his life. Built wind
tunnels and performed numerous
studies of drag and lift.

The dramatic drag crisis at Re ≈ 2.5 × 105 was ﬁrst carefully observed (and published) by Gustave Eiffel
in 1914 [3, p. 282]. The crisis is caused by a transition from laminar to turbulent ﬂow in the boundary
layer of the forward-facing half of the sphere, accompanied by a front-to-back shift in the separation point
for the turbulent wake that trails the sphere. At a Reynolds number just beyond the drag crisis, the wake
is narrower than before, entailing a smaller loss of momentum, i.e. smaller drag. At still higher Reynolds
numbers the drag coefﬁcient regains part of its former magnitude, while at supersonic speeds the drag crisis
disappears and the terminal drag rises to around unity.
The Reynolds number at which the boundary layer becomes turbulent depends on the surface properties
of the sphere. Roughness tends to facilitate the generation of a turbulent boundary layer and moves the onset
of turbulence to sometimes much lower Reynolds number. This is the deeper reason for manufacturing golf
balls with surface dimples. A golf ball ﬂying at a typical speed of 30 m s−1 has Re ≈ 1.6 × 105 which is
below the drag crisis for a smooth ball, but not for a dimpled one. The lower drag on a dimpled ball permits
it to ﬂy considerably longer for a given initial thrust. The seams of a tennis ball serve the same function,
whereas a ping-pong ball is quite smooth. A ping-pong ball ﬂying at 10 m s−1 has Re ≈ 5 × 104 , and even
if turbulence could be triggered seams or dimples would probably interfere with the game.

Terminal speed
The variation in drag with Reynolds number makes the calculation of the terminal speed of a spherical ball
somewhat more complicated than equation (19.14). Equating the force of gravity with the drag we obtain
instead of (19.13) for ρ1 > ρ0 ,
(ρ1 − ρ0 ) 4 πa 3 g0 = 1 C D ρ0 πa 2 U 2 ,

Since C D depends on the Reynolds number, this is an implicit equation for the terminal velocity except for
very large Reynolds numbers where C D is constant. The terminal velocity grows with the square root of the
density, implying that the terminal kinetic energy of a falling sphere grows with the square of the density.
This is why projectiles and bombs provided with heavy metal jackets (made, for example, from depleted
uranium) are used to penetrate concrete structures and rock.
Example 19.3.1 (Skydiver terminal speed): A skydiver weighing 70 kg curls up like a ball with
radius a = 50 cm and average density ρ1 ≈ 133 kg m−3 . Taking C D ≈ 0.3 and ρ0 ≈ 1 kg m−3 ,
we obtain U = 76 m s−1 = 273 km h−1 . The corresponding Reynolds number is Re = 4.7 × 106 ,
conﬁrming the approximation used.

19.4 Beyond spherical shape
The general arguments given in section 19.1 showed that in creeping ﬂow the drag on an arbitrary body is
proportional to viscosity, velocity, size and a shape-dependent dimensionless factor. Using the Stokes’ drag
(19.12) as a baseline, we may write the drag on an arbitrary body as
= 6πηa S U,

(19.24)

where a S is a characteristic length, sometimes called the Stokes radius. The Stokes radius may be
determined from a measurement of the terminal speed of the falling object,
aS =

m g0
,
6πηU

(19.25)

where m is the mass of the body corrected for buoyancy.
The Stokes radius may be calculated analytically for some simple bodies, for example a circular disk
of radius a. In the two major orientations of the disk, we have [79, p. 178],

 8 ≈ 0.85 disk orthogonal to ﬂow




≈ 0.57 disk parallel to ﬂow.
9π
In spite of the vast geometric difference between the two cases, the Stokes radii are of the same order of
magnitude. For general bodies of non-exceptional geometry, one may estimate the Stokes radius from the
surface area or the volume of the body.
At high Reynolds numbers, where viscosity plays a diminishing role, the drag coefﬁcient may be
deﬁned as
CD =

(1/2)ρ0 AU 2

,

(19.27)

where A is some area that the body presents to the ﬂow. For blunt bodies the area may be taken to be the
‘shadow’ of the body on a plane orthogonal to the direction of motion. For a given shape, the drag force
= C D 1 ρ0 AU 2 ,
2

(19.28)

exposes the dependence on the ﬂuid (ρ0 ), the body size (A), and the state of motion (U ). Barring the
presence of a drag crisis, typical values for C D are of the order of unity for bodies of non-exceptional
geometry. A ﬂat circular disk orthogonal to the ﬂow has C D ≈ 1.17, whereas a circular cup with its
opening towards the ﬂow has C D ≈ 1.4 [80, p. 460]. If on the other hand the disk is inﬁnitely thin and

The ‘drag crisis’ denotes a precipitous drop in drag on a sphere
that happens when the laminar
boundary layer turns turbulent,
causing the point of separation
of the trailing wake (top) to shift
rearwards (bottom), thereby narrowing the trailing wake.

and there is still room for improvement. In modern times drag-reducing helmets have also appeared on the
heads of bicycle racers and speed skaters, giving the performers of these sports quite alien looks. Among
animals, drag reduction yields evolutionary advantages, which has led to the beautiful outlines of fast ﬂyers
and swimmers, like falcons and sharks. The density of water is about a thousand times that of air, implying
a thousand times larger form drag (19.28) in water than in air, although this effect is partly offset by the
higher velocities necessary for ﬂight. This has forced swimming animals towards extremes of streamlined
shapes. The mackerel has thus reduced the drag coefﬁcient of its sleek form to the astonishingly low value
of 0.0043 at Re ≈ 105 , an order of magnitude lower than for a swimming human [75, p. 143]. Since
√
muscular power is roughly the same, birds should typically be capable of moving about 1000 ≈ 30 times
faster than ﬁsh of the same size and shape, which seems quite reasonable.

Problems
19.1 Tiny unicellular animals in the sea die and their carcasses settle slowly towards the bottom. Assume
that an animal’s carcass is spherical with diameter 10 µm and average density 1.2 times that of water.
Calculate the time it takes for the carcass to settle to the bottom of the deep sea (depth 4 kilometres).
19.2 A microscopic spherical grain of vulcanic (or cosmic) dust of radius a enters the homentropic
atmosphere (section 4.6) at a height z. Determine the time t0 it takes for the grain to settle to the ground
under the assumption that the density of the grain is much larger than the density of air, and that Stokes law
is valid at any height with the actual density and viscosity of air at that height. Evaluate the settling time
numerically for reasonable values of the parameters.

19.3 A spherical particle begins to fall from rest in constant gravity. Determine how the particle reaches

The conductor of a carousel knows about ﬁctitious forces. Moving from horse to horse while collecting
tickets, he not only has to ﬁght the centrifugal force trying to kick him off, but also has to deal with the
dizzying sideways Coriolis force. On a fast carousel with a ﬁve metre radius and turning once every six
seconds, the centrifugal force is strongest at the rim where it amounts to about 50% of gravity. Walking
across the carousel at a normal speed of one metre per second, the conductor experiences a Coriolis force of
about 20% of gravity. Provided the carousel turns anticlockwise seen from above, as most carousels seem
to do, the Coriolis force always pulls the conductor off his course to the right. The conductor seems to
prefer to move from horse to horse against the rotation, and this is quite understandable, since the Coriolis
force then counteracts the centrifugal force.
The Earth’s rotation creates a centrifugal ‘antigravity’ ﬁeld, reducing effective gravity at the equator
by 0.3%. This is hardly a worry, unless you have to adjust Olympic records for geographic latitude. The
Coriolis force is even less notable at the Olympics. You have to move as fast as a jet aircraft for it to amount
to 0.3% of a per cent of gravity. Weather systems and sea currents are so huge and move so slowly compared
to the Earth’s local rotation speed that the weak Coriolis force can become a major player in their dynamics.
The Coriolis force guarantees that low pressure weather cyclones on the northern half of the globe always
turn anticlockwise around low pressure regions, whereas high pressure cyclones turn clockwise.
In this chapter we shall investigate the strange behaviour of ﬂuids in rotating containers, mainly due to
the Coriolis force. At the end we shall debunk the persistent ‘urban legend’ about the sense of rotation of
bathtub vortices.

20.1 Fictitious forces
When dealing with a moving object, for example a rotating planet, it is often convenient to give up the
inertial coordinate system and instead attach a ﬁxed coordinate system to the moving object. In a noninertial, accelerated coordinate system, the laws of mechanics take a different form. The acceleration on
the left-hand side of Newton’s second law must be corrected by terms deriving from the motion of the
coordinate system, and when these terms are shifted to the right-hand side they can be interpreted as forces.
As these forces apparently have no objective cause, in contrast to forces caused by other bodies, they are
called ﬁctitious. A better name might be inertial forces, since there is nothing ﬁctitious about the jerk you
experience when the bus suddenly stops.

Velocity and acceleration in steady rotation
In this chapter we shall only be concerned with steadily rotating coordinate systems, such as those we use
on Earth. Consider a Cartesian coordinate system rotating with constant angular velocity relative to an
inertial system. Without loss of generality we may take the z-axis to be the axis of rotation. The coordinates

Differentiating once with respect to time t, we ﬁnd the particle velocity v = d x/dt in the rotating system
expressed in terms of its velocity v = d x /dt in the inertial system, plus extra terms arising from
differentiation of the sines and cosines. For example
vx = vx cos t + v y sin t −

rotation vector is not necessarily aligned with the z-axis.

Centrifugal and Coriolis forces

Gaspard-Gustave
Coriolis
(1792–1843). French mathematician. Worked on friction and
hydraulics. Introduced the terms
‘work’ and ‘kinetic energy’ in the
form used today. Deﬁned what is
now called the Coriolis force in
1835.

The force f acting on a point particle in the inertial system depends in general on the position x and
3
velocity v = d x /dt of the particle. Think, for example, of the force of gravity f = −Gm M x / x
from a point particle of mass M which depends on x (but not on v ). In the rotating system the transformed
force is naturally deﬁned to be
f =A· f .

(20.5)

Since |x| = x , this deﬁnition makes the transformed gravitational force take the same form in the rotating
and inertial systems, f = −Gm M x/ |x|3 . If the velocity appears in the force, it must be transformed using
(20.4b).
Multiplying (20.4c) by m, Newton’s second law in the inertial system, mw = f , becomes in the
rotating system,

Fictitious forces on Earth
The effect of the centrifugal force on Earth is primarily to ﬂatten the spherical shape in such a way that
it conforms to an equipotential surface. It was shown in section 7.4 on page 91 that the direction of the
combined gravitational and centrifugal force is always orthogonal to the equipotential surface everywhere
on Earth, and thus by deﬁnition vertical. The magnitude of the centrifugal force is only a fraction
q = 2 a/g0 ≈ 1/291 of standard gravity, and thus generally negligible. If precision is needed, one must
use the expression (7.31) for the effective surface gravity which properly takes into account the centrifugal
ﬂattening.
The Coriolis force is different. Let us introduce a local ﬂat-Earth coordinate system tangential to the
surface at a given point with the x-axis towards the east and the y-axis towards the north. In this reference
frame the Earth’s rotation vector is = (0, sin θ, cos θ) where θ is the polar angle. The components of
the Coriolis acceleration g C = −2 × v, expressed in terms of the velocity v = d x/dt then become,
C
gx =

2 cos θ v y − 2 sin θ vz ,

y

(20.8c)

2 sin θ vx .

At the poles θ = 0, 180 ◦ the Coriolis force is always horizontal, and at the equator θ = 90 ◦ it is always
vertical for horizontal motion with vz = 0.
C
The vertical Coriolis force gz is very small compared to gravity. Even for a modern jet aircraft ﬂying
on an east-west course at middle latitudes at a speed close to the velocity of sound, it amounts to only
about 0.3% of gravity, which accidentally is of the same order of magnitude as the correction due to the
centrifugal force. So we may ordinarily ignore the vertical Coriolis force along with the centrifugal force
in most Earthly matters. We shall also ignore the Coriolis force due to the vertical component of velocity
vz . A jet plane experiences again only a Coriolis acceleration in a westerly direction of magnitude 0.3% of
gravity during upwards vertical ﬂight at the speed of sound.
C
The conclusion is that under normal circumstances only the ﬁrst terms in gx and in g C need to be
y
considered, leading to a purely two-dimensional Coriolis acceleration which we write in the form,
C
gx = 2 ⊥ v y ,

g C = −2 ⊥ vx ,

C
gz = 0

⊥ is the local angular velocity

(20.10)

For all practical purposes, the Coriolis force in a local ﬂat-Earth coordinate system looks as if the Earth
were indeed ﬂat and rotated around the local vertical with the local angular velocity ⊥ . A good number to
know is that at middle latitudes θ ≈ 45 ◦ we have 2 ⊥ ≈ 10−4 s−1 . At this latitude the period of rotation
of a Foucault pendulum is 2π/ ⊥ ≈ 34 h, irrefutably proving that the Earth rotates under your feet.

For compressible ﬂow (17.27) the ﬁctitious terms must similarly be added to the right-hand side.
As discussed in the preceding section, the centrifugal force can generally be ignored at the surface of
the Earth, though not in laboratory experiments with rotating containers, such as Newton’s bucket (page
87). Formally, the gravitational and centrifugal ﬁelds may in an incompressible ﬂuid be included in the

of large-scale motion and general
circulation of the atmosphere.

The Rossby number
Let us again characterize the ﬂow by a length scale L and a velocity scale U . For nearly ideal steady ﬂow
with large Reynolds number, Re = U L/ν
1, the advective term dominates the viscous term (except
near boundaries). The interesting quantity is therefore the ratio between the advective acceleration and the
Coriolis acceleration, called the Rossby number

For nearly ideal ﬂow the Coriolis force is signiﬁcant only if Ro 1, in other words for U
the general rule is that the Coriolis force only matters when the ﬂow velocity U is of the same magnitude
or smaller than the typical variation L in the local rotation velocity across the system.
Ocean currents and weather cyclones are relatively steady phenomena. The characteristic speeds are
metres per second for the ocean currents and tens of metres per second for winds over distances of the
order of a thousand kilometres. With a local angular velocity 2 ≈ 10−4 s−1 one gets a Rossby number
Ro ≈ 0.01 for ocean currents and Ro ≈ 0.1 for weather cyclones. Both of these phenomena are thus
dominated by the Coriolis force, but the ocean currents by far the most.
When you (of size L = 1 m) swim with a speed of U ≈ 1 m s−1 , the Rossby number becomes
Ro ≈ 104 , and the Coriolis force can be completely neglected. The water draining out of your bathtub
moves with similar speeds over similar distances, making the Rossby number just as large and the Coriolis
force just as insigniﬁcant as for swimming (see also section 20.5). In space stations designed for long-term
habitation, gravity must for health reasons be simulated by rotation, and the large Coriolis force will play
havoc in ballistic games like Ping-Pong, football, and basket ball (see problem 20.1).

When the Ekman number is small, the viscous force can be neglected relative to the Coriolis force. For large
Reynolds number and moderate Rossby number, the Ekman number is automatically small. In a natural
system on Earth, such as the sea and the atmosphere, the huge Reynolds number makes the Ekman number
extremely small. The Ekman number is normally only of order unity close to boundaries where viscosity
always comes to dominate over advection. Here the interplay between viscous and Coriolis forces gives
rise to a highly interesting boundary layer, called the Ekman layer which we shall analyse in section 20.4.

20.3 Geostrophic ﬂow
In natural large-scale systems, the Rossby number and Ekman numbers are so small, Ro, Ek
1, that
one can in the ﬁrst approximation ignore both the viscous and the advective terms in the Navier–Stokes
equations. Such a ﬂow completely dominated by the Coriolis force is said to be geostrophic.
Dropping both advective and viscous terms in (20.11), we arrive at the remarkably simple Navier–
Stokes equation for steady geostrophic ﬂow,

∇ p∗ = 0.
ρ0

(20.16)

Much like in hydrostatics, it states that the effective pressure gradient must always balance the Coriolis force
but because of the special form of the Coriolis force, this equation has strong and peculiar consequences.
The most spectacular is that geostrophic ﬂow is essentially two-dimensional.

Water level in an open canal
The Coriolis force may tilt an otherwise horizontal surface of a moving ﬂuid. Let, for example, a constant
water current ﬂow with velocity U through a canal of width d. If the canal runs along the x-direction
and the angular rotation is around the z-direction, the effective pressure will according to (20.16) satisfy
∇x p∗ = ∇z p∗ = 0 and thus be independent of both x and z. From the y-component of (20.16) we get, .

In order to check our intuition we use (20.12) with a gravitational potential = g0 z and no centrifugal
force. Apart from an unimportant constant the true pressure is p = p∗ − ρ0 g0 z = −ρ0 (2 U y + g0 z). The
water level z = h(y) at the open surface is determined from the requirement that the true pressure p should
be constant at the free surface, so with the boundary condition h(0) = 0 we get,
h(y) = −

2 U
y.
g0

(20.18)

This conﬁrms our intuition; on the northern half of the globe the Coriolis force always makes the water
level highest on the right-hand bank of a stream.
Example 20.3.1: For a 10 km wide strait and a current ﬂowing at 1 m s−1 , the difference in water
level at the two sides of the strait due to the Coriolis force is about 10 cm at middle latitudes. Although
Ro = U/2 d ≈ 1, the use of the geostrophic equation (20.16) is nevertheless justiﬁed, because the
advective term vanishes for an x-independent ﬂow in the x-direction (like in Poiseuille ﬂow), and the
Reynolds number, Re ≈ 1010 is so large that viscous forces can be ignored.

Isobaric ﬂow and weather maps
An immediate consequence of the geostrophic equation (20.16) is that
v · ∇ p∗ = 0,

(20.19)

which means that the effective pressure is constant along streamlines. In horizontal motion the gravitational
force plays no role and the effective pressure is the same as the hydrostatic pressure. This means that
streamlines and isobars coincide in geostrophic ﬂow. This is also well known from weather maps where
wind directions can be read off from the isobars.
To read off the correct sign for the wind direction one must also use the fact that the Coriolis force
makes winds on the northern hemisphere turn anti-clockwise around low pressure regions (cyclones) and

clockwise around regions with high pressure (anti-cyclones). Quantitatively we may invert the geostrophic
equation (20.16) to calculate the wind velocities from the pressure gradients. Using · v = 0 we ﬁnd

Were it not for the Coriolis force, air masses would stream along the negative pressure gradient, from high
pressure towards low pressure regions. On the northern hemisphere, the Coriolis force generates cyclones
by making the air that begins to stream towards the low pressure veer to the right until it is aligned with the
isobars. Funnily enough, the same mechanism creates anticyclones.

just as we did in the case of the open canal.
The invariance of the effective pressure under translations along the axis of rotation actually extends to
the whole ﬂow. To verify this, we use that the curl of a gradient vanishes, and ﬁnd from the geostrophic
equation (20.16) and the divergence condition ∇ · v = 0,

The ﬂow ﬁeld v is also a function of x and y only, implying that the ﬂow is essentially two-dimensional.
This result is the Taylor–Proudman theorem. To the extent that weather cyclones satisfy the conditions for
steady geostrophic ﬂow, one may conclude that the same large-scale wind patterns are found all way up
through the atmosphere [55].

Taylor columns
The Taylor–Proudman theorem is a strange result, which predicts that if one disturbs the ﬂow of a rotating
ﬂuid at, say, z = 0, then the pattern of the disturbance will, after all time-dependence has died away, have
been copied to all other values of z. This is even true when the disturbance is caused by a three-dimensional
object with ﬁnite extent in the z-direction. A so-called Taylor column (of disturbed ﬂow) is created in the
rotating ﬂuid. Taylor columns are sometimes also called Proudman pillars.
In spite of the strangeness, many experiments beginning with Taylor’s own in 1923 have amply veriﬁed
the existence of Taylor columns. Even a body moving steadily along the axis of rotation, such as a falling
sphere, will push a long column of ﬂuid in front of itself, and trail another behind it. The mechanics
underlying the formation of Taylor columns derives from a complicated interplay between the advective
and viscous terms left out in the geostrophic equation (20.16), and it is not easy to give an explanation in
simple physical terms [7].

20.4 The Ekman layer
Boundary layers arise around a body in nearly ideal ﬂow, because viscous forces must necessarily come
into play to secure the no-slip boundary condition. Steady boundary layers are normally asymmetric with
respect to the direction of the ‘slip-ﬂow’ outside the layer, being thinnest at the leading edge of a body
and thickening towards the rear. This happens even at an otherwise featureless body surface and may be

understood as a cumulative effect of the slowing down of the ﬂuid by the contact with the boundary. The
further downstream from the leading edge of a body, the longer time will the ﬂuid have been under the
inﬂuence of shear forces from the boundary, and the thicker the boundary layer will be. In chapter 28 we
shall analyse boundary layers in general, but in this section we shall solve the much simpler case of the
Ekman boundary layer in a rotating system.
A ﬂuid in geostrophic ﬂow must also form boundary layers around the bodies immersed in it. For small
bodies the effect of the rotation is negligible, but for larger bodies with ﬂow velocity of the same scale
as the local rotation speed, i.e. for Ro = U/2 L
1, the Coriolis force comes to play a major role in
the formation of boundary layers. As the ﬂow velocity rises from zero at the boundary to its asymptotic
value in the geostrophic slip-ﬂow outside the boundary, the Coriolis force becomes progressively stronger,
making the ﬂow veer more and more to the right (for anti-clockwise rotation). This geostrophic cross-wind
effectively ‘blows away’ accumulated ﬂuid and prevents the downstream growth of the boundary layer.
Such a boundary layer, conﬁned to a ﬁnite thickness by the Coriolis force, is called an Ekman layer.

º

Ekman layer solution
Outside the Ekman layer we assume that there is a steady geostrophic ﬂow in the x -direction with velocity
vx = U , accompanied by an effective pressure p∗ = −2ρ0 U y in the y -direction, as for canal ﬂow (page
283). In looking for a solution which interpolates between the static boundary and the geostrophic ﬂow, we
again exploit the symmetry of the problem. As long as the centrifugal acceleration can be ignored (which
it can), the equations of motion as well as the boundary conditions are independent of the exact position in
x and y , i.e. invariant under arbitrary translations in these coordinates. It is then natural to guess that there
may be a maximally symmetric solution v = v(z) which is also independent of x and y and only depends
on the height z .
With this assumption, mass conservation ∇z vz = 0 implies that the vertical velocity component is a
constant. Since it has to vanish on the non-permeable boundary z = 0 it vanishes everywhere, vz = 0. The
ﬂow in the transition layer is horizontal and independent of x and y , but varies with height z . Since the
advective term vanishes, (v · ∇)v = (vx ∇x + v y ∇ y )v(z) = 0, the Navier–Stokes equation including the
Coriolis force becomes,
0=

2
2 v y − ∇x p∗ /ρ0 + ν∇z vx ,

2
0 = −2 vx − ∇ y p∗ /ρ0 + ν∇z v y ,
0 = −∇z p∗ /ρ0 .

(20.23a)
(20.23b)
(20.23c)

From the last equation it follows that the effective pressure is independent of height z and consequently for
all z equal to its value p∗ = −2ρ0 U y in the geostrophic ﬂow outside the boundary layer. Inserting this
result, the equations of motion now simplify to
2
ν∇z vx = −2 v y

2
ν∇z v y = −2 (U − vx ).

(20.24)

This is a pair of coupled homogenous differential equations for U − vx and v y . From the ﬁrst we get
2
v y = −(ν/2 )∇z vx and inserting this into the second, we get a single fourth-order equation
4 2
(U − vx ).

the roots of k 4 = −4/δ 4 are k = ±(1 ± i)/δ. The roots with positive real part are of no use, because

form,
U − vx = Ae−(1+i)z/δ + Be−(1−i)z/δ ,

where A and B are integration constants and where the last expression is obtained from the ﬁrst equation in

Applying the no-slip boundary condition, vx = v y = 0 for z = 0, we ﬁnd A = B = U/2, and the ﬁnal
solution becomes,
vx = U 1 − e−z/δ cos z/δ ,
v y = U e−z/δ sin z/δ.

(20.29)

Evidently δ is a measure of the thickness of the Ekman layer. Note that δ is independent of U , so the Ekman
layer has the same thickness everywhere even if the velocity of the geostrophic ﬂow should vary from place
to place.
In ﬁgure 20.1a the velocity components are plotted as a function of scaled height z/δ in units of the
asymptotic ﬂow U . One notes that vx ﬁrst overshoots its asymptotic value, and then quickly returns to
it. The y-component also oscillates but is 90◦ out of phase with the x-component. The direction of the
velocity close to z = 0 is 45◦ to the left of the asymptotic geostrophic ﬂow. Plotted parametrically as a
function of height, the velocity components create a characteristic spiral, called the Ekman spiral, shown in
ﬁgure 20.1b. The damping is however so strong that only the very ﬁrst turn in this spiral is visible.
The presence of an Ekman layer of the right thickness has been amply conﬁrmed by laboratory
experiments. For the atmosphere at middle latitudes the thickness (20.26) becomes δ = 55 cm when
the diffusive viscosity ν = 1.54 × 10−5 m2 s−1 is used. This disagrees with the measured thickness of the
Ekman layer in the atmosphere which is more like a kilometre. The reason is that atmospheric ﬂow tends
to be turbulent rather than laminar with an effective viscosity that can be up to a million times larger than
the diffusive viscosity [55]. We shall not go further into this question here.

∗ Ekman upwelling and suction
If the geostrophic ﬂow does not run along the x-direction, but has components Ux and U y , the Ekman ﬂow
(20.29) becomes instead,
vx = Ux 1 − e−z/δ cos z/δ − U y e−z/δ sin z/δ,

(20.30a)

v y = U y 1 − e−z/δ cos z/δ + Ux e−z/δ sin z/δ.

(20.30b)

If furthermore the velocity components Ux (x, y) and U y (x, y) change slowly with x and y on a large scale
L
δ, this expression should still be valid, because the thickness (20.26) is independent of the velocity of
the asymptotic geostrophic ﬂow.
The presence of an Ekman layer underneath a slowly varying geostrophic ﬂow generates in fact a nonvanishing asymptotic ﬂow Uz (x, y) in the z-direction. To ﬁnd it we calculate the derivative of the vertical
ﬂow component vz inside the Ekman layer using mass conservation ∇ · v = ∇x vx + ∇ y v y + ∇z vz = 0,
and we ﬁnd from (20.30)
∇z vz = −∇x vx − ∇ y v y = ∇x U y − ∇ y Ux e−z/δ sin z/δ.

20.5. STEADY BATHTUB VORTEX IN ROTATING CONTAINER

287

Here we have used that geostrophic ﬂow also has to satisfy the divergence condition, ∇x Ux + ∇ y U y = 0.
We recognize the factor in parenthesis on the right-hand side as the geostrophic vorticity in the z -direction.
Integrating the above equation over z and using that vz = 0 for z = 0, we obtain
vz = 1 δ ∇x U y − ∇ y Ux [1 − e−z/δ (cos z/δ + sin z/δ)],
2

(20.31)

an equation which is most easily veriﬁed by differentiation after z . Evidently, the vertical velocity is of size
U δ/ L , which is always smaller than the geostrophic ﬂow U by a factor δ/ L
1.
For z
δ the exponential falls away, and there remains a vertical component in the asymptotic
geostrophic ﬂow
Uz = 1 δ(∇x U y − ∇ y Ux ).
2

(20.32)

Since it is independent of z , it is not at variance with the geostrophic nature of the exterior ﬂow or the
Taylor–Proudman ‘vertical copy’ theorem.
If the geostrophic vorticity ωz = ∇x U y − ∇ y Ux is positive, i.e. of the same sign as the global rotation,
ﬂuid wells up from the Ekman layer (without changing its thickness). This is, for example, the case for
a low-pressure cyclone, where the cross-isobaric ﬂow inside the Ekman layer towards the centre of the
cyclone is accompanied by upwelling of ﬂuid. Conversely if the geostrophic vorticity is negative, as in
high-pressure anticyclones, ﬂuid is sucked down into the Ekman layer from the geostrophic ﬂow. Both of
these effects tend to equalize the pressure between the centre and the surroundings of these vast vortices.

20.5 Steady bathtub vortex in rotating container
In the laboratory, gravity-sustained vortices may be created by letting a liquid, typically water, run freely out
through a small drain-hole in the centre of a slowly rotating cylindrical container. The liquid lost through the
drain is constantly pumped back into the container. In the steady state the pump provides the kinetic energy
of the liquid falling out through the drain, and its angular momentum is provided by the motor rotating
the container. The container is drained through a very small hole and we shall for simplicity disregard the
inﬂuence of the outer container wall.
In the following we shall repeatedly refer to the experiment1 shown in ﬁgure 20.2 with the parameters
given in the ﬁgure caption. In this experiment, a steady ﬂow pattern with a beautiful central vortex
is established after about half an hour. The vortex is remarkably stable and its ﬂow can be studied
experimentally by modern imaging techniques. The needle-like central depression is accompanied by a
very rapid central rotation of more than 150 turns per second, or nearly 10 000 rpm, which is as fast as a
formula one car engine rotates at full throttle!
Experimentally, the bulk of the vortex outside the surface depression is found to take the shape of a line
vortex with azimuthal velocity, vφ = C/r in the rotating coordinate system of the container. The azimuthal
Reynolds number of the line vortex is independent of r ,

vortex in the water surface. The radius of the drain-hole is 1 mm, the asymptotic water level is L = 11 cm
and the container radius 20 cm. At 18 rpm the central dip is 6 cm, and the volume discharge through the
drain is 3.16 cm3 s−1 , corresponding to an average drain velocity of 101 cm s−1 . The circulation constant
is measured to be C = 16.0 cm2 s−1 and the inner core rotates about 150 turns per second! A. Anderson et
al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 91 (2003) 103402-1.
We shall call this the Rossby radius, and in the experiment of ﬁgure 20.2 we ﬁnd R = 2.1 cm. Well inside
the Rossby radius for r
R , the Coriolis force is small compared to the advective force, and the vortex
will resemble the bathtub-like vortices to be discussed in chapter 26, except that there is marked upﬂow
from the Ekman layer at the bottom outside the drain. At the other extreme, well beyond the Rossby radius
for r
R, the ﬂow will be purely geostrophic.

Cylindrical geostrophic ﬂow
The Taylor–Proudman ‘copycat’ theorem guarantees that in the geostrophic regime the ﬂow cannot depend
on the vertical height z well away from the boundaries. Assuming further that the ﬂow is rotationally
invariant, it follows that the velocity components in cylindrical coordinates, vr,φ,z , are only functions of r .
The geostrophic equation (20.16) now decomposes into the three equations,
∇r p∗ = 2ρ0 vφ ,

∇φ p∗ = −2ρ0 vr ,

∇z p∗ = 0.

(20.36)

By the usual argument, the uniqueness of the pressure forbids any φ-dependence, so the second equation
leads to vr = 0. The effective pressure can then be obtained by integrating the two other equations. Note
that whereas the radial ﬂow always has to vanish, we ﬁnd apparently no restrictions on the azimuthal ﬂow
vφ or the upﬂow vz . In particular, it does not follow from this argument that the azimuthal ﬂow must take
the form of a line vortex, vφ = C/r .
The main conclusion is that geostrophic ﬂow can never carry any inﬂow towards the drain. This is, in
fact, equivalent to the previously derived result that ﬂow lines and isobars coincide in geostrophic ﬂow. The
only way inﬂow can occur is through deviations from clean geostrophic ﬂow, and that happens primarily in
the Ekman layer close to the bottom of the container, and inside the Rossby radius.

The Ekman layer valve
The asymptotic upﬂow from the Ekman layer (20.32) is controlled by the vorticity of the geostrophic ﬂow.
Since the Taylor–Proudman theorem guarantees that the upﬂow is independent of z, and since there can
be no geostrophic inﬂow, this upﬂow will reach unabated the nearly horizontal open surface at top of the
container. But there it has nowhere to go, so the only possibility that remains is for the upﬂow and thus the

vorticity of the geostrophic ﬂow to vanish, and this is only possible for vφ = C/r (see problem 18.22). To
complete the argument, one also has to verify that the Ekman layer which will also form at the upper open
surface is incapable of diverting any large upﬂow towards the drain. Therefore it is essentially the ﬁnite
vertical extent of the rotating ﬂuid that forces the ﬂow to be that of a line vortex!

(20.38)

This is a fundamental result which connects the primary circulating ﬂow with the secondary inﬂow towards
the drain. The Ekman layer in effect acts as a valve that only allows a certain amount of ﬂuid to ﬂow
towards the drain per unit of time. In the experiment of ﬁgure 20.2 the circulation constant was measured to
be C ≈ 16.0 cm2 s−1 , leading to a total predicted inﬂow of Q ≈ 3.66 cm3 s−1 . Since the whole inﬂow has
to go down the drain, this is in fair agreement with the measured drain ﬂow of Q = 3.16 cm3 s−1 , especially
in view of the difﬁculties in measuring the circulation constant. If at all signiﬁcant, the discrepancy could
be caused by the ﬁnite radial size of the container which has been ignored here.

Inner vortex
Inside the Rossby radius the nonlinear advective forces take over, but there will still exist a thin—in fact
thinner—Ekman-like layer close to the bottom2 . But even if the circulating primary ﬂow is that of a line
vortex, the nonlinearities will now cause an upwelling of ﬂuid from the bottom layer. The bulk ﬂow is no
more geostrophic, so there is no injunction against the upﬂow turning into an inﬂow directed towards the
centre of the vortex. Thus, the general picture is that the secondary ﬂow creeps inwards along the bottom
through the Ekman layer outside the Rossby radius, ﬂares up vertically from the bottom inside, and then
turns towards the centre. Finally it dives sharply down into the drain.

20.6 Debunking an urban legend
Let us now turn to the ‘urban legend’ concerning the direction of rotation of real bathtub vortices and their
dependence on the Earth’s rotation. The legend originates in the correct physical theory of the Coriolis
force, amply conﬁrmed by the everyday observation of weather cyclones. So the urban legend can only be
debunked by quantitative arguments, usually not given much attention in urban circles.
Suppose to begin with that our bathtub is essentially inﬁnitely large and that the water level is
L = 50 cm. Bernoulli’s theorem tells us that the drain velocity is at most W = 2g0 L ≈ 300 cm s−1 .
Taking the drain radius to be a = 2.5 cm, the maximal drain discharge rate becomes Q ≈ 6 litres per second.
This seems not unreasonable for bathtubs that typically contain hundreds of litres of water. Assuming
furthermore that the bulk of the ﬂow is perfectly laminar, we ﬁnd the Ekman thickness δ ≈ 14 cm due to
Earth’s rotation at middle latitudes. From (20.38) we get the vortex circulation constant, C ≈ 140 cm2 s−1 ,
corresponding to a Rossby radius of R = 12 m. Most bathtubs are not that big and this shows that the
Earth’s rotation can only have a little inﬂuence on a real bathtub vortex, in spite of the many claims to the
contrary. A swimming pool of Olympic dimensions is on the other hand of the right scale. What matters for
the man-sized bathtub is much more the bather’s accidental deposition of angular momentum in the water
while getting out.
There is, however, the objection that the effect of the Earth’s rotation could show up, if the water were
left to settle down for some time before the plug is pulled. For that to happen, the Rossby number (20.14)
would have to become comparable to unity. Taking the diameter of a real tub to be A ≈ 1 m, this implies
that the water velocity near the rim of the tub should not be larger than 2 A ≈ 0.1 mm s−1 . This seems
terribly small, not much larger than the thickness of a human hair per second!

layers, J. Fluid. Mech. 487, (2003) 81.

20. ROTATING FLUIDS
The following argument indicates what patience is needed to carry out a successful experiment. After
the initial turbulence from ﬁlling the tub has died out, the water settles into a laminar ﬂow which is further
slowed down under the action of viscous forces (although the Reynolds number for a ﬂow with velocity
0.1 mm s−1 is still about 100). Viscosity not only smoothes out local velocity differences but also secures
that the ﬂuid eventually comes to rest with respect to the container. The typical viscous diffusion time over
a distance L is t ≈ L 2 /4ν, as we have seen for momentum diffusion on page 233. In a bathtub with a water
level of L = 50 cm, the time it takes for the bottom of the container to inﬂuence the water at the top is about
t ≈ 17 h at middle latitudes! To make the experiment work, you must not only let the water settle for a few
times 17 hours, but also secure that no heat is added to the water which may generate convection, and that
no air drafts are present in and around the container3 .

Computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) is a whole ﬁeld in its own right [29, 2, 73]. Swift modern computers
have to a large extent replaced wind tunnels and wave tanks for the design of airplanes, ships, cars, bridges
and in fact any human construction that is meant to operate in a ﬂuid. The same richness of phenomena
which makes analytic solutions to the equations of ﬂuid mechanics difﬁcult to obtain also makes these
equations hard to handle by direct numerical methods. Secondary ﬂows, instabilities, vortices of all sizes
and turbulence complicate matters and may require numerical precision that can be hard to attain. The
inﬁnite speed of sound in incompressible ﬂuids creates its own problems, and on top of that there are
intrinsic approximation errors and instabilities.
As in computational elastostatics (chapter 13) there are a number of steps that must be carried out in
any simulation. First, it is necessary to clarify which equations one wishes to solve and even there make
simpliﬁcations to the problem or class of problems at hand. Secondly, continuous space must be discretized,
and here there are a variety of methods based on ﬁnite differences, ﬁnite elements or ﬁnite volumes. Thirdly,
a discrete dynamic process must be set up which guides the initial ﬁeld conﬁguration towards the desired
solution. Most often this process emulates the time evolution of ﬂuid dynamics itself, as described by the
Navier–Stokes equations. Finally, convergence criteria and error estimates are needed to monitor and gain
conﬁdence in the numerical solutions.
The methods presented in this chapter are applicable to a variety of steady and unsteady ﬂow problems.
Here we shall only compute two-dimensional laminar ﬂow in a channel of ﬁnite length between parallel
plates and determine how it turns into the well-known parabolic Poiseuille proﬁle downstream from the
entrance, and how far the inﬂuence of the entrance reaches.

21.1 Unsteady, incompressible ﬂow
In numeric elastostatics (chapter 13) we were able to set up an artiﬁcial dissipative dynamic, called gradient
descent, that guided the displacement ﬁeld towards a static solution with minimal elastic energy. This
technique cannot be transferred to computational ﬂuid dynamics, because a solution to the steady-state
equations does not correspond to an extremum of any bounded quantity (problem 21.1). Instead we shall
attempt to copy nature by simulating the complete set of time-dependent Navier–Stokes equations (17.27).
Appealing to the behaviour of real ﬂuids, the natural viscous dissipation built into these equations should
hopefully guide the velocity ﬁeld towards a steady-state solution.
There is, however, no guarantee—either from Nature or from the equations—that the ﬂow will always
settle down and become steady, even when the boundary conditions are time-independent. We are all

too familiar with the unsteady and sometimes turbulent ﬂow that may spontaneously arise under even the
steadiest of circumstances, as for example a slow river narrowing down or even worse, coming to a water
fall. But this is actually not so bad, because a forced steady-state solution is completely uninteresting when
the real ﬂuid refuses to end up up in that state. We do not, for example, care much for the Poiseuille solution
(18.26) to pipe ﬂow at a Reynolds number beyond the transition to turbulence, or for that matter the laminar
ﬂow around a sphere in an ideal ﬂuid (section 16.7). If steady ﬂow is desired, one must keep the Reynolds
number so low that there is a chance for it to become established.

Field equations
Not to complicate matters we shall only consider incompressible ﬂuids with constant density ρ = ρ0 , for
which the divergence vanishes at all times,
∇ · v = 0.

(21.1)

The Navier–Stokes equation (17.16) is written as an equation of motion for the velocity ﬁeld,
∂v
= F − ∇ p,
∂t

(21.2)

F = −(v · ∇)v + ν∇ 2 v + g,

(21.3)

with

where ν = η/ρ0 is the kinematic viscosity, and p = p/ρ0 might be called the ‘kinematic pressure’. For
convenience we have also introduced the special symbol F to denote the local acceleration arising from
inertia, viscosity and gravity, but not pressure. The gravitational ﬁeld could in principle be included in an
effective pressure p∗ = p + ρ0 , although that would obscure the boundary conditions we might want to
impose on the real pressure. In the following we shall simply assume that the ﬁeld of gravity is constant.

Poisson equation for pressure
In incompressible ﬂow the pressure is determined indirectly through the vanishing of the divergence of
the velocity ﬁeld, as discussed on page 237. Calculating the divergence of both sides of (21.2), we ﬁnd a
Poisson equation for p,
∇ 2 p = ∇ · F.

(21.4)

This is the condition which must be fulﬁlled in order that the velocity ﬁeld remains free of divergence
at all times. Knowing the velocity ﬁeld v at a given time we can calculate the right-hand side and solve
this equation with suitable boundary conditions to determine the pressure everywhere in the ﬂuid at that
particular instant of time.
Solutions to the Poisson equation are, however, non-local functions of the source, basically of the
same form as the gravitational potential (3.24). Any local change in the velocity ﬁeld at a point x is
via the Poisson equation above instantaneously communicated to the pressure at any other point x in the
ﬂuid, albeit damped by the 1/ x − x dependence on distance. The non-local changes in pressure are
then communicated back to the velocity ﬁeld via the Navier–Stokes equation (21.2). The pressure thus
links the velocity ﬁeld at any instant of time non-locally to its immediately preceding values, even for
inﬁnitesimally small time intervals. Pressure instantly informs the world at large about the present state of
the incompressible velocity ﬁeld.
Physically, unpleasant non-local behaviour is caused by the assumption of absolute incompressibility
(21.1), which is just as untenable in the real world of local interactions as absolute rigidity. So, we have
again come up against a physical limit arising from our simplifying assumptions. As pointed out before,
incompressibility should be viewed as a property of the ﬂow rather than of the ﬂuid itself. The unavoidable
compressibility of real matter will in fact limit the rate at which pressure changes can propagate through a
ﬂuid to the speed of sound. Nevertheless, such a conclusion does not detract from the practical usefulness
of the divergence condition (21.1) for ‘normal’ ﬂow speeds well below the speed of sound.

Boundary conditions
In many ﬂuid dynamics problems, ﬁxed impermeable walls guide the ﬂuid between openings where it
enters and leaves the system. At ﬁxed walls the velocity ﬁeld must vanish at all times, because of the
impermeability and no-slip conditions which respectively require the normal and tangential components to
vanish. Setting v = 0 on the left-hand side of the equation of motion (21.2) we obtain a boundary condition
for pressure: ∇ p = F on any ﬁxed boundary. The same is the case at a ﬂuid inlet, where the velocity ﬁeld
is typically ﬁxed to an externally deﬁned constant value, v = U. Outlet velocities are usually not controlled
externally, and as a boundary condition on the velocity ﬁeld one may choose the vanishing of the normal
derivative, (n · ∇)v = 0. Alternatively, the stress vector may be required to vanish, but that is a bit harder
to implement.

21.2 Temporal discretization
Suppose the current velocity ﬁeld is v(x, t) and the current pressure ﬁeld p(x, t). From these ﬁelds we
can calculate the current acceleration ﬁeld F(x, t) and then use the equation of motion (21.2) to move the
velocity ﬁeld forward in time through a small but ﬁnite time step t,
v(x, t +

t) = v(x, t) + F(x, t) − ∇ p(x, t)

(21.5)

t 2 , but less error-prone higher-order
Taylor expansion of the left-hand side shows that the error is Ç
schemes are also possible [2, 29]. Provided the velocity ﬁeld is free of divergence and the pressure satisﬁes
(21.4), the new velocity ﬁeld obtained from this equation will also be free of divergence.

Divergence suppression
But approximation errors cannot be avoided in any ﬁnite step algorithm. Since for this reason the current
velocity ﬁeld may not be perfectly free of divergence, it is more appropriate to demand that the new velocity
ﬁeld is free of divergence, i.e. ∇ · v(x, t + t) = 0. Calculating the divergence of both sides of (21.5) we
obtain a modiﬁed Poisson equation for the pressure
∇2 p = ∇ · F +

∇·v
.
t

(21.6)

The factor 1/ t ampliﬁes the divergence errors, so that this Poisson equation will primarily be concerned
with correction of divergence errors and only when they have been suppressed will the acceleration ﬁeld
F gain inﬂuence on the pressure. In practice, the stepping algorithm (21.5) can get into trouble if the
divergence becomes too large. It is for this reason important to secure that the initial velocity ﬁeld is
reasonably free of divergence. In a complicated ﬂow geometry that can in fact be quite hard to attain.

Stability conditions
There are essentially only two possibilities for what can happen to the approximation errors in the course of
many time steps. Either the errors will become systematically larger, in which case the computation goes
straight to the land of meaningless results, or the errors will diminish or at least stay constant and ‘small’,
thereby keeping the computation on track. It takes careful mathematical analysis to determine a precise
value for the upper limit to the size of the time step. The result depends strongly on both the spatial and
temporal discretization (see for example [2, 59]), and may range from zero to inﬁnity depending on the
particular algorithm that is implemented.
Here we shall present an intuitive argument for the stability conditions that apply to the straightforward
numerical simulation (21.5) on a spatial grid with typical coordinate spacings x, y and z. The
conditions to be derived may be understood from the physical processes that compete in displacing ﬂuid
particles in, say, the x-direction. One is momentum diffusion due to viscosity which effectively displaces
√
the particle by ν t in a time interval t (see page 233). Another is advection with velocity vx which
displaces the particle a distance |vx | t. Finally, there is the gravitational ﬁeld which typically displaces

and similarly for the other coordinate directions. In practice trial-and-error may be used to determine where
in the neighbourhood of the smallest of these limits instability actually sets in.
The diffusive condition is most restrictive for large viscosity, the advective for high velocities, and the
gravitational in strong gravity. The allowed time step is generally largest for the coarsest spatial grid, which
on the other hand is blind to ﬁner details of the ﬂow. Thus, there is a payoff between the detail desired in
the simulation and its rate of progress. High detail entails slow progress, and thus a high cost in computer
time.

21.3 Spatial discretization
In the discussion of numeric elastostatics we described a method based on ﬁnite differences with errors of
only second order in the grid spacings (section 13.2 on page 166). Although it is possible to solve simple
ﬂow problems using this method, most such problems will beneﬁt from a somewhat more sophisticated
treatment. The method of staggered grids to be presented here comes at essentially no cost in computer
memory or time, but does complicate matters a bit. A number of applications of this method are given in
[29].

For simplicity we shall limit the following discussion to two-dimensional ﬂow in the x y-plane, as
exempliﬁed by the ﬂow in a channel between parallel plates (section 18.2 on page 246). The restriction
to two dimensions still leaves ample room for interesting applications. Generalization to three dimensions
is straightforward.
Two-dimensionality is taken to mean that the ﬁelds can only depend on x and y and that vz = 0. The
equations of motion now simplify to

The solid zigzag-curve f (x)
between the two straight lines
has constant central difference
(13.5) on the grid!

zigzag behaviour is typical of
the ‘leapfrog’ errors that may
arise when using the naive central
differencing scheme of section
13.2.

(21.10b)

and the divergence condition becomes
∇x vx + ∇ y v y = 0.

(21.11)

The stresses may of course be calculated, but are not as important here as in numeric elastostatics, because
boundary conditions are most often speciﬁed directly in terms of the velocities.

Midpoint differences
The main objection to the central difference ∇x f (x) deﬁned in (13.5) is that it spans twice the ﬁxed interval
x around the central point x to which it ‘belongs’. As was remarked there, this opens for ‘leap-frog’ or
‘ﬂip-ﬂop’ instabilities in which neighbouring grid points behave quite differently. The problem becomes

21.3. SPATIAL DISCRETIZATION

295

particularly acute in the interplay between the equations of motion and the instantaneous Poisson equation
for pressure.
One way out is to recognize that the difference in ﬁeld values between two neighbouring grid-points
properly ‘belongs’ to the midpoint of the line that connects them. If we denote the coordinates of the points
by x ± (1/2) x the central difference around the midpoint x ,
∇x f (x) =

f (x + (1/2) x) − f (x − (1/2) x)
,
x

(21.12)

has errors of only second order in the grid spacing. This is what is really meant by saying that the difference
‘belongs’ to the midpoint.
But the midpoints between grid points are not themselves part of the grid. We could of course double
the grid and use (1/2) x as grid-spacing, thereby including the midpoints, but that would just bring us
back to the situation we started out to correct. Instead we shall think of the midpoint values of ﬁelds and
their derivatives as being virtual, meaning that they may arise during a calculation but are not retained as
part of the information kept about the ﬁelds on the grid.

The ﬁnite difference between the

Staggered grids
To see how this works out, let us discretize the divergence condition (21.11) writing it in terms of midpoint
differences in the point (x, y)
∇x vx (x, y) + ∇ y v y (x, y) = 0.

(21.13)

Since (x, y) has to be the common midpoint for both coordinate directions, we should have direct access to
vx in (x ± (1/2) x, y) and v y in (x, y ± (1/2) y), but not necessarily in (x, y). Repeating this argument
throughout space (see ﬁgure 21.1), we conclude that the grids for the ﬁelds vx and v y do not overlap
anywhere, but are systematically shifted, or staggered, with respect to each other.
In effect we have doubled the grid in both spatial directions, but the new grid is viewed as composed
of four interlaced grids of the original type, each carrying some of the ﬁelds and their derivatives.
Systematically, the coordinates of the four grids may be written

x = x0 + i x x + jx
2

y = y0 + i y y + j y
y
2

(21.14a)
(21.14b)

where i x , i y are integers and jx , j y are binary, taking only the values 0 or 1. The grid of common midpoints
used in calculating the divergence is arbitrarily chosen to be jx = j y = 0, so that we may denote the four
grids by 00, 10, 01, and 11 (marked with different symbols in ﬁgure 21.1). Thus, vx is deﬁned on the 10grid and v y on the 01-grid. We shall see below that the pressure p naturally belongs to the 00-grid, whereas
there is no fundamental ﬁeld associated with the 11-grid, only derivatives of the ﬁelds (see however problem
21.3).
The four staggered grids create a tiling of the plane with rectangular cells numbered by i x and i y , each
cell containing four grid points numbered by jx and j y . Generalization of this scheme to three dimensions
is straightforward, though harder to visualize. In three dimensions there will be eight staggered grids
characterized by three integers and three binary variables.

Double differences
2
A double derivative, say ∇x , is particularly simple when represented by midpoint differences. Combining
the two levels of midpoint differencing we obtain (see ﬁgure 21.2)
2
∇x f (x) =

f (x +

x) + f (x −

x) − 2 f (x)

,

(21.15)

and because of the symmetry in x the errors are of second order only. Geometrically the two levels of
2
midpoint differences bring the double derivative back to the point it ‘originated in’, so that both ∇x vx and
2 v belong to the same grid as v (i.e. the 10-grid).

The differences ∇x vx and ∇ y vx
in a 10-point (ﬁlled circle) may
be found as averages of the neighbouring values on the 00- and
11-grids, respectively marked by
crosses and asterisks. The value
of v y on the 10-grid (ﬁlled circles) is obtained by averaging
over all four nearest neighbours
on the 01-grid (open circle).

The local acceleration ﬁelds Fx and Fy should be discretized on the same grids as vx and v y (i.e. on 10 and
01) for the equations of motion (21.9) to be fulﬁlled with ﬁelds and derivatives calculated in the same point.
The double derivatives in the viscous terms present in this respect no problems, and neither does the
gravitational acceleration nor the pressure gradient which automatically ends up on the right grids. In the
advective term, −vx ∇x vx , there is the problem that ∇x vx belongs to the 00-grid and not to the 10-grid as
we would like it to. In order to keep errors to second order one must form the average of ∇x vx over the two
neighbouring 00-values. Similarly, in the advective term, −v y ∇ y vx , the derivative ∇ y vx is naturally found
on the 11-grid, it must also be averaged over the two nearest neighbours to get its 10-value. The worst case
is v y for which the value on the 10-grid is obtained as the average over the four nearest neighbours on the
01-grid.
Marking the averaged quantities with brackets we may write the discretized acceleration ﬁelds in the
form (see problem 21.4 for the explicit expressions)

required to be of second order only.

derivatives, themselves represented by midpoint differences. Conveniently, it ends up on the same grid as
the ﬁeld itself.

Solving the discrete Poisson equation
During an iteration cycle the accelerations (21.16) are calculated from the current values of the discrete
ﬁelds at time t , and afterwards the corresponding pressure at time t is calculated by solving the discretized
version of the Poisson equation (21.6),

.
t

(21.18)

The solution to this equation may be found by means of relaxation methods, for example gradient descent
(see section 13.1 on page 165), in which the pressure p(x, y, t) undergoes successive changes of the form
2
2
∇x + ∇ y p − s ,

δp =

(21.19)

where > 0 is the step size and s(x, y, t) is the source (the right-hand side of (21.18)). The relaxation
algorithm converges towards a solution to ∇ 2 p = s for sufﬁciently small because it descends along the
steepest downwards gradient towards the unique minimum of a quadratic ‘energy’-function (see problem
21.2).
Denoting the nth approximation to the solution by pn (x, y, t), the discretized relaxation process may
be written explicitly as
pn+1 (x, y, t) = pn (x, y, t) +

2
2
∇x + ∇ y pn (x, y, t) − s(x, y, t) .

(21.20)

Starting with some ﬁeld conﬁguration p0 (x, y, t) and imposing boundary conditions after each step, this
process will eventually lead to the desired solution, p(x, y, t). The problem is, however, that simple gradient
descent is slow, too slow in fact to be applied inside every time step. Conjugate gradient descent [59, p.
420] offers considerable speed-up by calculating the optimal step-size directly, but as it turns out there are
still faster methods.
From the double difference operator (21.15) we see that the coefﬁcient of pn in (21.20) is 1 −
2 (1/ x 2 + 1/ y 2 ), and this suggests the following reparametrization of the step-size
=

(21.21)

where ω is the dimensionless convergence parameter. This choice allows a precise deﬁnition of what is
meant by underrelaxation (ω < 1) and overrelaxation (ω > 1). Straightforward gradient descent, in which
the new ﬁeld ( pn+1 ) is calculated all over the grid before replacing the old ( pn ), only converges when
underrelaxed.
In successive overrelaxation or SOR (see [2, p. 231] and [29, p. 35]), the new value pn+1 (x, y, t) at
a grid point replaces the old value pn (x, y, t) as soon as it is calculated during a sweep of the grid. The
method converges for 1 < ω < 2 and in practice the best value for ω may be located by trial-and-error,
usually not far below the upper limit, say ω = 1.7–1.9. Since this algorithm sweeps sequentially through
the grid, one should be aware that it may create small asymmetry errors in an otherwise symmetric situation.
But fast it is, on small grids often converging in just a few iterations, after the initial phase has passed.

21.4 Channel entrance ﬂow
A simple and—from the look of it—well-behaved problem concerns the steady entrance ﬂow pattern in a
channel between two parallel plates with gap width d. Directly at the entrance, the ﬂow is thought to be
uniform with a ﬂat velocity distribution which downstream smoothly turns into the characteristic parabolic
Poiseuille shape. The typical distance for this to happen is the so-called entrance length, L .
Momentum diffusion due to viscosity (page 233) tends to iron out all velocity gradients unless they
are maintained by external forces. Near the entrance to the channel where the ﬂuid speed is uniformly U ,
the velocity gradients and stresses on the sides are very large but soften progressively as the ﬂuid moves
downstream. The action of viscosity slows the ﬂuid down near the sides of the channel, and since the
volume ﬂux must be the same throughout the channel, it has to speed up in the centre.
Sketch of the expected shape of
the velocity proﬁle at various
distances downstream from the
entrance.

Estimates
We have previously seen (page 233) that the diffusive momentum spread in a time interval t √ a typical
has
√
95% range of δ ≈ 3.5 νt and reaches the middle of the channel from both sides for 3.5 νt ≈ d/2,
or t ≈ 0.02 d 2 /ν. Multiplying by the velocity U we obtain an estimate for the entrance length,
L ≈ 0.02 U d 2 /ν, and introducing the Reynolds number Re = U d/ν, we get
L
≈ k Re,
d

(21.22)

with k ≈ 0.02. For Re ≈ 100 which is squarely in the laminar region, the entrance length is thus estimated
to be about twice the channel width, and about 40 times the channel width for Re ≈ 2000. In the turbulent
regime the entrance length on the contrary decreases with growing Reynolds number. The inﬂuence of the
entrance is always expected to be notable at least for a length of the same size as the channel width d. For
1, we consequently expect that L /d becomes a
smaller values of the Reynolds number, say for kRe
ﬁxed constant, independent of the Reynolds number.
In the present numerical simulation we shall attempt to verify the linear growth with Reynolds number
in the laminar regime and determine the magnitude of the coefﬁcient k as well as the constant value of L /d
for k Re 1.

Boundary conditions for channel
ﬂow.

The channel is two-dimensional with the ﬂuid coming in from the ‘west’ and leaving to the ‘east’ with
the plates to the ‘south’ and ‘north’. At the western entrance to the channel, x = 0, the velocity ﬁeld is
uniform vx = U with no cross ﬂow, v y = 0. The exit ﬂow at x = L is determined by the dynamics,
and we shall just assume that the ﬂow has stabilized in this region with longitudinally constant velocities,
∇x vx = ∇x v y = 0, as in ideal Poiseuille ﬂow. On the impermeable southern and northern walls of the
channel we must of course have v y = 0, together with the no-slip condition, vx = 0. In velocity-driven
ﬂow, the boundary conditions on pressure follow from the velocity conditions, and will be discussed below.

Initial data
The equations of motion must be supplied with initial data that fulﬁll the spatial boundary conditions and the
condition of vanishing divergence. This is not nearly as simple as it sounds, even if there is great freedom
in the choice of initial data and even if the ﬁnal steady state is supposed to be independent of this choice.
The problem becomes particularly acute if the boundaries are of irregular shape which they will always be
in any realistic ﬂow problem.
Here we shall choose the initial velocity and pressure ﬁelds (at t = 0) to be
vx = U,

v y = 0,

p=0

(21.23)

everywhere inside the channel. This certainly fulﬁlls the divergence condition, but has a discontinuous
jump on the sides of the channel due to the no-slip boundary conditions. The initial ﬁelds also fulﬁll the
Poisson equation for pressure (21.6).

Figure 21.3. A rectangular region (solid line) is discretized using staggered grids, here with Nx = 5 and
N y = 3. Boundary conditions necessitate one layer of data outside the region on all sides, requiring (7 × 5)
basic cells. The velocity vx is deﬁned on the 10-points (ﬁlled circles), v y on the 01-points (open circles)
and the pressure p on the 00-points (crosses).

The grid
The rectangular region of size L × d is discretized using staggered grids with coordinate intervals
x = L/Nx and y = d/N y , where Nx and N y are integers. This requires an array of (Nx +2)×(N y +2)
basic cells to cover the region of interest. In a computer program, any ﬁeld value belonging to a basic cell
is represented by an array, f (x, y) ↔ f [i x , i y ], indexed by the cell indices. At the eastern and northern
borders only half the cell data is needed, as indicated in ﬁgure 21.3.
The discrete boundary conditions have to reﬂect that not all ﬁeld values are known precisely on the
border. At the entrance, the vx -condition remains vx = U because this ﬁeld is known on the border, but
the v y -condition must be implemented as v y = 0, where the average is over the nearest points on both
sides of the border. On the northern and southern walls, the roles are reversed, and we have vx = 0 and
v y = 0. At the eastern exit, the condition ∇x v y = 0 become ∇x v y = 0. Since there is no data on vx east of
the border, the condition ∇x vx = 0 can only be approximatively implemented as a backwards difference,
−
∇x vx = 0.
General theory of the Poisson equation tells us that we either need to know the pressure itself or its
normal derivative on the boundary. Since at all times vx = U on the western border, the time-step equation
(21.17) implies that ∇x p = Fx there. The value of Fx on the western boundary (obtained from (21.16))
requires knowledge of vx further to the west, data that is not available on the grid. As it turns out, we do
not in fact need to know Fx on the border. To see this, the discretized Poisson equation (21.18) is written as
∇x ∇x p − Fx + ∇ y ∇ y p − Fy =

∇x vx + ∇ y v y
.
t

(21.24)

Since ∇x p = Fx on the border, the boundary value of ∇x p − Fx is always zero wherever it appears in the
ﬁrst term, independent of the boundary value of Fx . Thus, the value of Fx at the ﬂuid inlet never appears in
the Poisson equation and has therefore no inﬂuence on the solution. In practice, it is convenient to choose
the boundary value Fx = 0, and correspondingly ∇x p = 0.
On the solid walls y = 0, d, similar arguments lead to ∇ y p = 0. Finally, at x = L we only know that
2
∇x vx = 0 and consequently ∇x p = ∇x Fx from the equation of motion (21.17). Again it follows from
analysis of the Poisson equation that the actual boundary value of Fx cannot inﬂuence the solution. In this
case one may either choose the pressure to be constant, p = 0, or better require Fx = 0 and ∇x p = 0 at
the exit.

Iteration cycle
The grid arrays for all the ﬁelds, vx [i x , i y ], v y [i x , i y ], p[i x , i y ], Fx [i x , i y ] and Fy [i x , i y ] are ﬁrst cleared
to zero, and then the velocity is initialized to vx [i x , i y ] = U for i x = 0, . . . , Nx and i y = 1, . . . , N y .
Assuming that we have obtained a current set of discrete ﬁelds at time t, the following iteration cycle
produces a new set of ﬁelds at t + t.
1. Calculate the new velocities vx and v y at time t + t from (21.17) in all internal points (i.e. not on the
boundary). Explicitly the internal grid points are given by i x = 1, . . . , Nx − 1 and i y = 1, . . . , N y
for vx , and i x = 1, . . . , Nx and i y = 1, . . . , N y − 1 for v y .
2. Use the boundary conditions (21.25) to determine boundary values of the velocities. Explicitly they
become
vx [0, i y ] = U,

vx [Nx , i y ] = vx [Nx − 1, i y ],

i y = 1, . . . , N y ,

v y [0, i y ] = −v y [1, i y ],

v y [Nx + 1, i y ] = v y [Nx , i y ],

i y = 1, . . . , N y − 1,

vx [i x , 0] = −vx [i x , 1],

vx [i x , N y + 1] = −vx [i x , N y ],

i x = 0, . . . , Nx ,

v y [i x , 0] = 0,

v y [i x , N y ] = 0,

i x = 0, . . . , Nx + 1.

Note the care that is necessary in the speciﬁcations of index ranges.
3. Calculate the new acceleration ﬁelds, Fx and Fy , at all internal points (with the same index ranges
as for the velocities) from (21.16) using the new velocity ﬁelds. The boundary values of the
accelerations remain zero.
4. Calculate the source of the Poisson equation (21.18) from the new ﬁelds at all internal points.
5. Solve the Poisson equation iteratively by means of the following subcycle.

Results
We shall ﬁx the mass scale by choosing unit density ρ0 = 1, the length scale by choosing unit plate distance
d = 1, and the time scale by setting the entry velocity U = 1. With these units the only parameter left in
the problem are the (now dimensionless) kinematic viscosity ν and the (also dimensionless) length L of the
channel. The Reynolds number is, for example, the reciprocal viscosity, Re = 1/ν . Here we shall mainly
present results for Re = 100. In view of the estimate (21.22) which predicts the entrance length to be 3 in
20 the length is chosen to be L = Re/10 whereas for Re
20
this case, we choose L = 10. For Re
it is chosen to be L = 2, because the entrance length is expected to be constant. The grid dimensions are
everywhere chosen to be Nx = N y = 40.
In ﬁgure 21.5(a ) the time evolution of the exit velocity is plotted together with the rise of the velocity
in the channel. Allowing for maximally 100 SOR iterations, the process converges to χ = 1% in about 50
time steps, corresponding to t = 0.3. It reaches 95% of the Poiseuille maximal velocity 1.5U in 400 time
steps corresponding to t = 2.48. The same is the case for the downstream rise of the steady ﬂow velocity
plotted in ﬁgure 21.5(b) which reaches 95% of its maximum at x = 2.34. The downstream evolution of
the velocity proﬁle towards the parabolic Poiseuille shape is shown in ﬁgure 21.4. In ﬁgure 21.6(a ) the
pressure in the middle of the channel is plotted as a function of x, and it also reaches the Poiseuille form
with constant gradient for x ≈ 2.5.
Finally, in ﬁgure 21.6(b) the entrance length, deﬁned as the point where vx has reached 95% of
maximum, has been plotted as a function of Reynolds number. It is remarkable that the same program
with identical convergence parameters covers a range of Reynolds numbers from nearly 0 to 5000. For
10 the entrance length becomes constant, L = 0.43d, and this makes sense because the inﬂuence
Re
of the entrance must always be notable at a distance compared to the channel width. At high Reynolds
numbers, Re 200, the linearity of the estimate (21.22) is conﬁrmed and we obtain k = 0.0197 in perfect
agreement with the rough estimate. There seems to be no sign of turbulence for Reynolds number between

Momentum, angular momentum, and kinetic energy are purely mechanical quantities that, like mass, are
carried along with the movement of material. Besides these mechanical quantities, there are thermodynamic
quantities such as internal energy and entropy, also transported along with the material. The mechanical
and thermodynamic quantities mentioned here are all extensive, meaning that the amount in a composite
body is the sum of the amounts in the parts. Other so-called intensive quantities, for example pressure and
temperature, are not additive like the extensive quantities.
We have already seen that mass is transported without actual loss or gain, as expressed by the local
and global equations for mass conservation. Extensive quantities are generally not conserved (except under
special conditions to be discussed), but have sources that create and destroy them. Forces create momentum,
moments of force create angular momentum, work creates kinetic energy. The global laws for extensive
quantities express the balance between creation and accumulation of a quantity, and basically state the
obvious: in any volume of matter the net amount of a quantity produced by the sources is either accumulated
in the volume or leaves it through the surface.
In this chapter we shall derive the global laws of mechanical balance in a systematic form which
clearly exposes their relation to the corresponding laws in Newtonian particle mechanics, and which is
also suitable for practical applications. For each of the laws we shall discuss the circumstances under which
the corresponding quantity is conserved. We shall see that mass, momentum and angular momentum are
in general conserved for isolated systems, whereas kinetic energy is not. Only when potential and internal
energies are included, do we arrive at a total energy which is conserved for isolated systems. This chapter
is mainly theoretical with only one key application for each quantity. In chapter 23 we shall apply the laws
of balance to a number of generic examples.

22.1 Connected tubes
We shall begin with a simple example of the use of mechanical energy conservation to derive how water
moves in one of the most basic experiments in ﬂuid dynamics, analysed by Newton himself in Principia
[53, proposition 44].
Consider a long straight tube with cross section A, bent through 180 ◦ somewhere in the middle and
placed with the open sections vertically upwards. Water is poured into the system, and as everybody knows,
gravity will eventually make the levels of water equal in the two vertical tubes. Before reaching equilibrium
the water sloshes back and forth with diminishing amplitude. Basic physics knowledge tells us that the
energy originally given to the water oscillates between being kinetic and potential, while slowly draining
away because of internal friction in the water.
Even if we do not know the exact solution to the ﬂuid ﬂow problem, we are nevertheless able to make a
reasonable quantitative estimate of the behaviour of the water. When the water level in one vertical tube is
raised by z relative to the equilibrium level, mass conservation tells us that it is lowered by the same amount

When the water is at rest, the
water level will be the same in
connected vertical tubes. The

the two vertical sections.

in the other vertical tube. Denoting the instantaneous velocity of the water in the tube by v and the full
length of the water column by L , the total mass of the water column will be ρ0 AL , where ρ0 is the constant
density of water, and the kinetic energy becomes (1/2)ρ0 ALv 2 . Since a small water column of height z
and weight g0 ρ0 Az has effectively been moved from one vertical tube to the other and thereby raised by
z relative to equilibrium, the potential energy becomes g0 ρ0 Az 2 . Adding these contributions we get the
following estimate for the total energy,
= 1 ρ0 ALv 2 + g0 ρ0 Az 2 .

(22.1)

For simplicity we assume that there is no friction to eat away the energy. The total energy must therefore
be conserved, so that its time-derivative has to vanish,

Using that v = dz/dt , we ﬁnd the differential equation,

(22.3)

The solution to this harmonic equation is of the form
z = a cos ωt,

(22.4)

with amplitude a and circular frequency ω = 2g0 / L . As noted by Newton, this is the frequency of the
small-amplitude oscillations of a pendulum with length L/2, but in contrast to the pendulum the motion of
the water is purely harmonic, also for large amplitudes.

22.2 Overview of the global laws
Before going into detailed discussion of the global laws, we shall here outline the contents of these laws.
We shall see that in continuum mechanics, the global laws of balance take nearly the same form as the
global laws of Newtonian particle mechanics (see appendix A).

Mechanical quantities
There are four global mechanical quantities that may be calculated for the material contained in any volume
V : the total mass M, the total momentum , the total angular momentum and the total kinetic energy
Ì . These quantities are deﬁned as integrals over densities of the form,

(22.5b)

Each of these deﬁnitions expresses that the quantity may be understood as the sum over the material particles
making up the body.

Mechanical laws of balance
Each of the mechanical quantities obeys a global law of balance completely analogous to the global laws
of Newtonian particle mechanics. In continuum physics the laws of balance of mass, momentum, angular
momentum and kinetic energy take the form,

where is the total force (9.16),
the total moment of force and P the total power (rate of work). The
ﬁrst two have already been derived in sections 15.3 and 15.5, whereas angular momentum balance and
kinetic energy balance will be derived below1 .
The global laws all follow from Cauchy’s equation of motion for continuous matter (15.35), and are
for this reason automatically fulﬁlled for any solution to the ﬁeld equations. Having found such a solution,
one should not worry about the balance of mass, momentum, angular momentum or kinetic energy. But
when one is unable to solve the ﬁeld equations and has to guess a simpliﬁed form of the solution, the laws
of balance impose two scalar and two vector constraints on the solution, in many cases sufﬁcient to make a
decent estimate of the system’s behaviour.

22.3 The control volume
In Newtonian particle mechanics, a ‘body’ is understood as a collection of a ﬁxed number of particles. In
continuum mechanics the notion of a body is much more general: any volume—usually called a control
volume—may be viewed as a ‘body’ at a given time. Intuitively we think of bodies as made from different
materials, but the surface of the control volume does not have to correspond to an interface between
materials with different properties, although it often is convenient to choose it to coincide with such an
interface. In the course of time the control volume V (t) with surface S(t) may be moved around and
deformed any way we desire, which is why it is called a control volume.
One may wonder whether it is really necessary to consider bodies this generally. Previously, for
example in the discussion of mass conservation and momentum balance, we have only considered
arbitrary ﬁxed volumes which do not change with time. A quick review of the example of
connected tubes in section 22.1 reveals, however, that the control volume we instinctively used there
encompasses all the water in the system and moves along with it. Not permitting arbitrarily moving
control volumes would in fact put unreasonable constraints on our freedom to analyse the physics of
continuous systems.

V (t)

S(t)

A ‘body’ consists of all the matter
contained in an arbitrary timedependent control volume V (t)
with surface S(t).

Speciﬁc quantities
Before proceeding to a discussion of the global laws of balance for mass, momentum, angular momentum
and kinetic energy, it is necessary to establish some general relations. For an arbitrary time-dependent
volume V (t) we let
Q(t) =

V (t )

q(x, t) d M =

V (t )

ρ(x, t) q(x, t) d V,

V (t + δt)
(22.7)

denote any of the eight components of the global mechanical quantities M, Èx , È y , Èz , Äx , Ä y , Äz and
Ì . Since the densities of all of the global quantities are proportional to the mass density, it is convenient to
factor it out and instead introduce the speciﬁc quantity, q = d Q/d M, as the local amount per unit of mass.
Whereas the speciﬁc mass is trivially unity, the speciﬁc momentum is the velocity v, the speciﬁc angular
momentum x × v, and the speciﬁc kinetic energy (1/2)v 2 . One might even say that the speciﬁc volume is
1/ρ.

Rate of change of a quantity
The time dependence of a global quantity Q has two origins: the changing density ρq and the changing
control volume V . In a small time interval δt the control volume changes from V (t) to V (t +δt). Expanding

Matter moves with velocity v
through the surface element d S
which itself moves with velocity
v S . The velocity of the matter
relative to the moving surface is
v − vS.

Reynolds’ transport theorem
If the surface of the control volume always follows the material, v S = v, it is said to be comoving (in which
case it is actually not under our control!). We shall, as before, use the symbol D/Dt for the material time
derivative, deﬁned as the rate of change of a quantity in a comoving volume, and ﬁnd from (22.8) with
v S = v,
∂(ρq)

d V + ρq v · d S.

(22.9)

Combining this equation with the general expression (22.8) for the rate of change, we may for an arbitrary
control volume write
DQ
dQ
=
+ ρ q (v − v S ) · d S.
(22.10)
Dt
dt
S
This equation goes under the name of Reynolds’ transport theorem (1903) and is the general basis for global
analysis in continuum physics. It has a fairly clear intuitive content: independent of how the control volume
moves, the material rate of change of an extensive quantity equals the actual rate of change of the quantity
in the control volume plus its net rate of loss through the surface.

Local and global rates of change
Using Gauss’ theorem on the surface integral in (22.9) we obtain a single volume integral with the integrand,
∂(ρq)
+ ∇ · (ρqv) = q
∂t

∂ρ
+ ∇ · (ρv) + ρ
∂t

∂q
+ (v · ∇)q .
∂t

Here the ﬁrst parenthesis vanishes because of the continuity equation (15.24) and the second parenthesis is
recognized as the local material time derivative (15.29) of the speciﬁc quantity q. Putting it all together we
arrive at the important relation,
DQ
Dq
ρ

d V.

(22.11)

The material derivative of a global quantity equals the integral of the density times the local material
derivative Dq/Dt of the speciﬁc quantity. This result facilitates enormously the derivation of the global
laws of balance.

+ ρ(v − v S ) · d S = 0.

(22.12)

Since the source vanishes, mass is always conserved in a comoving volume. Previously this relation was
obtained for a ﬁxed volume (page 194), but now we see that it may actually be applied in an arbitrary
moving control volume when Reynolds’ transport theorem is used to calculate the material rate of change.

Down the drain
Suppose a cistern ﬁlled with water is ﬂushed through a short drain pipe in the bottom of the container. The
drain pipe has cross section A, and the cistern is vertical with cross section A 0 . We choose a control volume
encompassing all the water in the cistern but not the pipe. As the cistern drains the horizontal water surface
moves whereas the other parts of the control surface are ﬁxed. This is an example of a control volume
which is neither ﬁxed nor comoving.
When the water level is z, the total mass of the water is M = ρ0 A 0 z, and the rate of mass loss through
the drain is ρ0 Av where v is the average velocity of the drain ﬂow. There is no mass ﬂux through the
moving open surface of the cistern. Global mass balance (22.12) and Reynolds’ transport theorem (22.10)
with q = 1 now leads to,
dz

=
+ ρ0 Av = ρ0 A 0

(22.13)

Since dz/dt = −v0 where v0 is the average downwards velocity of the water in the cistern, this becomes

volume,

22. GLOBAL LAWS OF BALANCE

Internal and external force
Whereas the contact forces acting on the surface of the control volume are always external, the body forces
acting in the volume V may be split into external and internal parts
f = f int + f ext ,

(22.18)

where f int is produced by the material inside the volume, and f ext by the material outside. Gravitational
and electromagnetic forces are two-particle body forces where a particle of volume d V situated at x acts
on a particle of volume d V at x with a force d 2 = f (x, x )d V d V , such that
f int =

f ext =

(22.19)

Both gravitational and electrostatic forces obey Newton’s third law, f (x, x ) = − f (x , x), and then
the total internal force vanishes,

Sketch of a rocket moving upwards with vertical velocity u
while emitting material of density
ρ and relative velocity U through
an opening of cross section A.
The control volume moves with
the rocket and follows the outside of the hull, cutting across the
exhaust opening. There is ambient air pressure p0 everywhere
around the rocket, also at the nozzle outlet. The small rise in pressure p at the front of the rocket
is the main cause of drag.

As a demonstration of how to use global momentum balance, we consider the launch of a small ﬁreworks
rocket. The rocket accelerates vertically upwards by burning chemical fuel and spewing the hot reaction
gases downwards. The gases are emitted from the rocket through an opening (nozzle) with cross section A,
and we assume for simplicity that the density of the gas ρ and its velocity U relative to the rocket remain
unchanged during the burn. We also assume that the gas velocity is much smaller than the velocity of sound,
which it is in toy rockets, so that the pressure at the exit may be taken to be equal to the ambient atmospheric
pressure p0 .
In this case it is most convenient to choose a control volume which follows the outside of the rocket,
cutting across the nozzle outlet. Such a control volume always moves with the instantaneous speed u of the
rocket. It contains at any moment all the material of the rocket, including the fuel and the burning gases,
but not the gases that have been exhausted through the nozzle. The rate of loss of mass through the nozzle,
Q ≈ ρ U A, is constant by the assumptions we have made. This implies that the rocket mass must decrease
linearly from its initial value M0 at t = 0, so that its mass at time t is,
M = M0 − Q t.

(22.21)

At the end of the burn, when all the fuel has been spent, a ‘payload’ mass M1 < M0 remains. The time it
takes to burn the fuel mass M0 − M1 is t1 = (M0 − M1 )/Q. After the burn the rocket ﬂies ballistically
like a cannon ball, subject only to the forces of gravity and air resistance. Here we are only interested in
establishing the equation of motion valid from lift-off to burn out.
The absolute vertical velocity (relative to the ground) of the exhaust gases is v = u − U , allowing us
to estimate the loss of vertical momentum (the surface integral in Reynolds’ transport theorem (22.10)) as
ρv(−U )(−A) = (u − U )Q. Assuming that the centre of gravity remains ﬁxed relative to the rocket (and
that is by no means sure), the total momentum is È = Mu, and the material derivative becomes, according
to Reynolds theorem,

(22.22)

In the last step we have used the expression (22.21) for the rocket mass.
The total vertical force on the rocket is the sum of its weight −Mg0 and the resistance or drag caused by
the interaction of the rocket’s hull with the air. Air drag has two components: skin drag from viscous friction
between air and hull, and form drag from the changes in pressure at the hull caused by the rocket ‘punching’
through the atmosphere. Form drag can, for example, be estimated from the Bernoulli stagnation pressure

rocket with form drag (solid) and without (dashed). The cusp in the velocity happens at the end of the burn
and signals the transition to ballistic ﬂight. The rocket has diameter 6 cm, total mass 1 kg, payload 0.2 kg
and form drag coefﬁcient C D = 1. The rocket burns for 3 s, emitting gases at a speed of 50 m s−1 . The
numeric solution of the rocket equation (22.24) shows that with form drag the rocket reaches a velocity of
45 m s−1 at the end of the burn and a height of 43 m. During the subsequent ballistic ﬂight, it reaches a
maximum height of 103 m about 6 s after start, and ﬁnally it falls back and hits the ground again with a
speed of 30 m s−1 about 11.5 s after start. Without form drag the rocket would reach a maximum height of
178 m about 8 s after start, and it would hit the ground with a speed of 60 m s−1 after 14 s.
increase at the tip of the rocket, p ≈ (1/2)ρ0 u 2 , where ρ0 is the density of air. Multiplying by the cross
section of the rocket A 0 , the estimate of the form drag becomes −(1/2)ρ0 u 2 A 0 (with opposite sign if u
is negative). Form drag thus grows quadratically with rocket speed, and at high velocity it dominates skin
drag which only grows linearly with velocity. Leaving out skin drag, the total vertical force on the control
volume may be written

where we have included a dimensionless factor C D , called the drag coefﬁcient, which takes into account
the actual shape of the rocket.

we ﬁnd the ‘rocket equation’ for vertical ﬂight during the burn,

(22.24)

This shows that the rocket will take off from rest u = 0 at t = 0 provided the initial acceleration is positive,
i.e. U Q > M0 g0 . The differential equation can only be solved numerically (except in vacuum for C D = 0
where it can be solved analytically; see problem 22.2), and the results are shown for a typical ﬁreworks
rocket in ﬁgure 22.1 with C D = 1. The ﬁgure also includes the period of ballistic ﬂight which follows the
burn and brings the rocket to a maximal height before it turns around and falls back to earth. One notes how
the form drag reduces the maximum height for this rocket to a little more than half of what it would be in
vacuum (dashed curve). If the rocket shape were made highly streamlined, the form drag coefﬁcient could
be made considerably smaller than unity, allowing it to attain greater heights for the same amount of fuel
(see page 449 for a general discussion of form drag).

22. GLOBAL LAWS OF BALANCE
Angular momentum depends on the origin of the coordinate system. If we shift the origin by x → x + a,
the angular momentum shifts by → + a × , unless the total momentum vanishes which is generally
not the case in ﬂuid systems. This deﬁnition is, however, not without subtlety (see problem 22.7).

thus shift in the same way so that the form of this relation is independent of the choice of origin.
From angular momentum balance it follows immediately that the total angular momentum is conserved
if and only if the total moment of force vanishes. It is, however, a bit more complicated to derive the global
form of the total moment than it was for the total force. Inserting the effective force (9.18), we ﬁnd the
identity

The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side is a divergence which by Gauss’ theorem leads to a surface integral,

total moment of force may be written,

Å=

(22.28)

In complete analogy with the total force, the total moment thus consists of the moment of the body forces
plus the moment of the contact forces acting on the surface of the volume.

Internal moment of force
Splitting the body force density into internal and external contributions (22.18), and assuming again that
we are dealing with two-particle body forces f (x, x ) obeying Newton’s third law, f (x, x ) = − f (x , x),
the moment of the internal body forces may be written as

In the second line we interchanged x and x and in the third we used the antisymmetry of the two-particle
force. If the two-particle forces are furthermore central, f (x, x ) ∼ x − x , which is the case for gravity
and electrostatics, the cross product vanishes, and we conclude that the internal moment of force vanishes,
int = 0. Under these conditions, internal forces can simply be ignored in the calculation of the moment
of force, and we have shown that the angular momentum is conserved for a system not subject to an external
moment of force.

Spinning a rotating lawn sprinkler
As an illustration of the use of angular momentum balance we now calculate how a rotating lawn sprinkler
spins after the pressure is turned on. Some rotating lawn sprinklers are constructed with two horizontal arms
of length R mounted on a common pivot. Each arm is a tube carrying water from the pivot towards a nozzle
that is bent by 90 ◦ with respect to the tube and elevated through an angle α against the azimuthal direction.
The nozzle outlet has cross section A and the water emerges with velocity U relative to the nozzle. When
the water is turned on, the sprinkler starts to rotate and reaches after a while a steady situation in which it
rotates with constant angular velocity, determined by the friction moment from the pivot.
We choose a control volume which follows the outer surface of the sprinkler, cutting across the nozzle
outlets and horizontally through the pivot. In cylindrical coordinates with the z-axis along the axis of
rotation, the angular momentum of the sprinkler around the z-axis is Äz = I where I is the moment of
inertia of the whole sprinkler plus water and > 0 is the instantaneous angular velocity. The moment of
inertia should be calculated in the usual way from the mass distribution in the arms, the pivot and the water
contained in the system. For incompressible water the moment of inertia is time-independent.
The water entering vertically through the pivot carries no angular momentum, so the pivot does not
contribute to the surface integral in Reynolds’ transport theorem (22.10) with q → x × v. In cylindrical
coordinates we have (x × v)z = r vφ , and since the azimuthal velocity of the water emerging from a nozzle
is vφ ≈ R − U cos α, the material derivative of Äz becomes (taking both arms into account),
D Äz

− U cos α)U A.

(22.29)

Disregarding air resistance, the only moment of force acting on the sprinkler arises from the (deliberately
imposed) friction in the pivot. Since the friction moment must be negative, Åz = −N, the angular
momentum balance becomes

Example 22.6.1 (Lawn sprinkler): A lawn sprinkler with radius R = 20 cm, nozzle outlet diameter
d = 4 mm, and nozzle elevation α = 30 ◦ , is designed to pass Q/ρ0 = 0.25 litre water per second
through its two arms and rotate once every 2 s in the steady state. The nozzle area becomes A =

0 = π s . The required friction moment that the pivot must deliver, N = RU Q cos α − R Q 0 =
0.4 Nm. The horizontal velocity of the water relative to the lawn is vφ = R 0 − U cos α ≈ −8 m s−1 ,
and the vertical velocity of the water is vz = U sin α ≈ 5 m s−1 . Assuming a ballistic orbit for the
water ﬂying across the lawn (disregarding air resistance) the diameter of the sprinkled region comes
to about D ≈ 4 vφ vz /g0 ≈ 16 m. The sprinkled area, A 0 = (1/4)π D 2 ≈ 200 m2 , receives about
Q/ρ0 A 0 ≈ 4 mm rain per hour from the sprinkler.

It must be emphasized that this is only the kinetic energy of the mean ﬂow of matter represented by the
velocity ﬁeld v, and that there is a ‘hidden’ kinetic energy associated with the fast thermal motion of the
molecules relative to the mean ﬂow. We shall return to this question in section 22.9 (see also problem 22.7).

The source of kinetic energy P is the total rate of work, or power, of the effective forces acting on the
material particles in the control volume. Formally, we may conclude that the kinetic energy is conserved
when the total power vanishes, but that is, as we shall see, not very useful, because the power rarely vanishes.
To derive a global expression for the power we use the expression (9.18) for the effective force density
to write,
v · f∗ −v · f =

the external contact forces, plus a third contribution which we (including the sign) interpret as the power of
the internal stresses.

The water ﬁrst accelerates
through the pipe while pouring
out through the exit. The kinetic
energy of the water in the
transition region between cistern
and pipe (dashed ﬂowlines) is
assumed to be negligible.

Internal rate of work
Although Newton’s third law guarantees that the contact forces between neighbouring material particles
cancel, the power of these forces does not cancel because neighbouring material particles have slightly
different velocities, as witnessed by the appearance of the velocity gradients ∇ j vi in the last term of (22.37).
Given that the displacement of a comoving material particle in a small time interval δt is δu i = vi δt,
we may employ (10.36) on page 129 to obtain the rate of work against the internal stresses,

(22.38)

Taking the sign into account, this is of course consistent with the interpretation of the last term in the
total power (22.37). We previously used this expression to calculate the rates of dissipative loss for
incompressible ﬂuids (17.18), as well as for compressible ﬂuids (17.30).

22.7. KINETIC ENERGY BALANCE

Pulling the plug
As an illustration of the use of kinetic energy balance, we return to the familiar example of a cistern being
drained through a narrow pipe. When the plug is pulled at the bottom of the cistern, the ﬂuid goes through
a short initial acceleration before steady ﬂow is established. We shall now calculate how the water ﬂow
becomes steady and how long it takes.
The drain is a horizontal pipe of length L and cross section A, and the cistern is vertical with large
A, continuously being reﬁlled to maintain a constant water level h. Initially the pipe is
cross section A 0
full and all the water is assumed to be at rest. The control volume is ﬁxed and contains all the water in the
system between the open surface, the pipe outlet and the walls of the cistern and pipe. Assuming that the
water is non-viscous and incompressible, the kinetic energy balance (22.35) in a ﬁxed control volume takes
the form

(22.39)

On the left-hand side we have the material time derivative D Ì /Dt expressed through Reynolds’ transport
theorem (22.10) with q → (1/2)v 2 . On the right-hand side we ﬁnd the total power, consisting of the rate
of work of constant gravity and the rate of work of the contact forces, in this case only the pressure. For
non-viscous incompressible ﬂuids, the rate of work of the internal contact forces vanishes according to
(17.18).
To estimate the various terms in this equation we shall again use the plug ﬂow approximation in which
the ﬂow is assumed to have the same vertical velocity throughout the cistern and the same horizontal
velocity throughout the pipe. In this approximation the average of a product of velocity ﬁelds equals the
product of the averages. We have previously seen (page 254) that for laminar viscous ﬂow in pipes much
longer than the entrance length, such an approximation is rather poor, but for non-viscous or turbulent ﬂow
it is not so bad.
Ignoring the transition region from the cistern to the pipe (see problem 22.5), the total kinetic energy
of the water in the system is approximatively given by the sum of the kinetic energies of the water moving
vertically down through the cistern with average velocity v0 and the water moving horizontally through the
pipe with average velocity v. Using mass conservation (Leonardo’s law), v0 A 0 = v A, to eliminate v0 we
ﬁnd,

Example 22.7.1 (Barrel of wine): For a cylindrical barrel of wine (example 16.3.2) with diameter
1 m and height 2 m, emptied through a spout with diameter 5 cm and length L = 20 cm, the effective
length becomes L 0 = 20.5 cm. The terminal speed is about 6 m s−1 , and the water obtains 96% of this
speed after just 0.13 s! If you try to put back the plug in the spout after merely half a second, there will
nevertheless be about 5.6 litres of wine on the ﬂoor (see problem 22.3).
Until now we have completely escaped the problem of how the pressure behaves inside the cistern and
in the pipe. Taking the x -axis along the pipe, and using that v does not depend on x , there will be no
comoving acceleration in the pipe, and the x -component of Euler’s equation (16.1) simply becomes

Quite reasonably, τ equals the time it takes the water to pass through the pipe at half the terminal speed. At

Since dv/dt takes the same value throughout the pipe, the pressure gradient will be independent of x .
Expressed in terms of the pressures p1 and p0 at the ends of the pipe, the gradient is ∂ p/∂ x = ( p0 − p1 )/L.
Finally, inserting the acceleration (22.45) and the solution (22.46) we obtain the pressure difference between
the pipe entry and the exit (or the cistern surface)

This shows that at t = 0 the entry pressure p1 equals the hydrostatic pressure of the water in the cistern, as
one would expect, and that it approaches atmospheric pressure p0 in the pipe in the characteristic rise time
τ . In reality there will remain a residual pressure drop in the pipe due to viscous friction (see section 18.4).

22.8 Mechanical energy balance
Even if kinetic energy is not conserved, kinetic energy balance can as shown in the preceding section be
very useful in obtaining an estimate of the solution to a ﬂuid mechanics problem by calculating the rate
of work of the forces acting on the system. In numerous practical situations the body force is entirely due
to a static external ﬁeld of gravity, f = ρ g = −ρ∇ , and in that case it is, as in ordinary mechanics,
convenient to introduce the potential energy in the gravitational ﬁeld,

Total contact power
Since D Î / Dt is the opposite of the body force contribution to the total power (22.37), it is convenient to
deﬁne the total mechanical energy as the sum of the kinetic and potential energies,

(22.54)

The ﬁrst term is the power of the external and the last the power of the internal contact forces. Evidently, the
mechanical energy is conserved for a comoving volume when the total power of the contact forces vanishes.
For a non-viscous, incompressible ﬂuid where σi j = − p δi j , the last term in (22.54) vanishes, such
that the mechanical energy will be conserved if the pressure does no net work on the surface. This was the
principle used intuitively in the analysis of connected tubes at the beginning of this chapter (section 22.1).
For a viscous incompressible ﬂuid, the last term is given by (17.18) and is always negative, showing that
viscosity always eats away the mechanical energy of a ﬂuid.

∗ 22.9 Energy balance in elastic ﬂuids
The global equation of mechanical energy balance (22.53) arises—so to speak—by ‘moving over’ the rate
of work of gravity from the right-hand side of the kinetic energy balance (22.35) to the left-hand side as a
potential energy. In general, it is also possible to ‘move over’ the power of the internal contact forces, the
last term in the contact power (22.54), such that the total energy takes the form
= Ì + Î + Í,

(22.55)

where

Í=

ρ u d V,

(22.56)

is called the total internal energy and u the speciﬁc internal energy. The speciﬁc internal energy contains
essentially all the information about the thermodynamics of the material in the control volume and is not
known in general. For particular types of matter, the most important being ideal gases, there are simple
explicit expressions for the speciﬁc internal energy (see below and appendix C).

Speciﬁc internal energy for non-viscous barotropic ﬂuids
Here we shall only carry through the analysis for non-viscous barotropic ﬂuids, for which the internal
energy is analogous to the potential energy stored in a compressed spring. Such ﬂuids are for this reason
often called elastic. In the absence of viscosity, σi j = − pδi j , the contact power (22.54) becomes,

22. GLOBAL LAWS OF BALANCE
The task is now to ﬁnd an expression for the speciﬁc internal energy which cancels the last term.
A ﬂuid in a barotropic state has a unique relationship between density and pressure, ρ = ρ( p), and the
so-called pressure potential,
w( p) =

the speciﬁc internal energy of a non-viscous barotropic ﬂuid to be (apart from an additive constant),

An incompressible non-viscous ﬂuid has constant density and pressure potential w = p/ρ , such that its

Concluding, we have shown that for a barotropic non-viscous ﬂuid the total energy is conserved when
the pressure performs no work on the surface of the control volume. We shall not present any applications
of this result, because it is equivalent to Bernoulli’s theorem.

Bernoulli’s theorem and energy balance
To ﬁnd the relationship between energy balance and Bernoulli’s theorem we assume that the ﬂow is steady
and apply energy balance to a ﬁxed control volume in the form of a tiny stream tube consisting of all the
streamlines that go into a tiny area A 1 and leave through the equally tiny area A 2 . Denoting the average
entry and exit velocities by v1 and v2 , the mass ﬂux through the tube is,

because no ﬂuid passes through the sides of a tube consisting of streamlines.
The total energy of the ﬂuid in the stream tube must be constant in steady ﬂow, i.e. d /dt = 0, such
that the material derivative obtained from Reynolds’ transport theorem (22.10) is entirely determined by the
rate of loss of energy through the surface of the tube. For a sufﬁciently narrow stream tube we have,

completely equivalent to energy balance for steady ﬂow in a non-viscous barotropic ﬂuid. Under these
circumstances, we do not gain further information about the system from energy balance than from applying
Bernoulli’s theorem.

A rocket accelerating in empty space while spewing hot gases in the opposite direction is at ﬁrst sight rather
mysterious, because there are no external forces to account for its acceleration. On reﬂection we understand
from momentum conservation that the high-speed gas streaming out of the rocket nozzle carries momentum
away from the rocket and thereby adds momentum to the rocket itself. But why are rockets and jet aircraft
said to be ‘reaction-driven’? What is reacting to what?
Fluids ﬂowing through tubes, pipes, ducts and conduits are important components in many of the
machines used in the home, in transport and industry. Everywhere in such a system the conduit walls
will act on the ﬂuid with contact forces that conﬁne and guide the ﬂuid. By Newton’s third law the ﬂuid
must respond with an equal and opposite reaction force. This deﬁnition is purely a matter of convention;
there is no deeper distinction between the agents in an action/reaction pair. With this convention one may
say that a rocket is driven by the reaction of the gas against the conﬁning contact forces exerted on it by the
inner walls of the rocket engine.
Lawn sprinklers, fans, windmills, hairdryers, propellers, pumps, water turbines, compressors and jet
engines are all examples of turbomachinery used everywhere today. In such machines the ﬂuid will likewise
exert a reaction moment of force on the main rotating part, called the rotor. Depending on the sign of the
reaction moment energy is either taken out of the ﬂuid as in a water turbine or put into it as in an air blower.
In this chapter we shall develop the formalism for reaction forces and moments, and apply it to a number
of generic examples. We shall see that it is sometimes quite a subtle task to unravel what is the true reaction
force on a given part of a machine, because forces may be transmitted to this part from far away through
stiff machine housing and supports.

against another force, but more akin to the ‘ﬁctitious’ centrifugal and Coriolis forces.

23. REACTION FORCES AND MOMENTS

Total force in steady ﬂow
In steady ﬂow, it is natural to choose a ﬁxed control volume. Since the ﬂow pattern always remains the
same, the total momentum of the material in the ﬁxed control volume will be constant, d /dt = 0, and
from momentum balance (23.1) it follows that the total external force on the control volume must be,

S

(23.2)

The total force is still given by the sum of the volume and contact forces (22.17), so this relation should be
seen as a constraint which necessarily must be satisﬁed by these forces to secure a steady ﬂow. Contrary
to hydrostatics (v = 0) where the total force on any volume has to vanish, the environment is required to
exert a generally non-vanishing total force on the control volume, determined by the net ﬂux of momentum
out of the control volume. Since the integrand vanishes at solid walls where v · d S = 0, it may always be
calculated from the ﬂow through the openings where ﬂuid is let in and out of the control volume.
From the total force, which is perfectly unambiguous, it is often fairly easy to determine the actual
reaction force according to one’s personal preferences concerning what acts and what reacts. We shall now
present some examples of how to use this method.

Reaction from a jet hitting a wall
A steady jet of water hits a ﬁxed wall and produces no backsplash in the process, but just streams uniformly
away over the wall (when gravity is ignored). A ﬁxed control volume is chosen to contain all of the water in
the jet with inlet far from the wall and the outlet far from the centre of the jet. The total force x normal to
the wall equals the momentum ﬂux in the x-direction through the inlet because the outﬂow is approximately
parallel with the wall and thus orthogonal to x. Let the inlet area be A, and let the magnitude of the average
inlet velocity be v, so that the total volume ﬂux through the inlet in the x-direction becomes −v A. The
momentum density along x is similarly −ρ0 v, leading to the following estimate of the total force on the
water,
2
x ≈ ρ0 v A.

A0

Ö

h

This force can only be due to the contact force from the wall and may be viewed as the wall’s reaction to
the impact of the incoming ﬂuid. Alternatively, − x may be viewed as the ﬂuid’s reaction to the conﬁning
forces from the wall. The argument also shows that x will be even larger, if there is backsplash from the
wall.

and the jet reaction about 350 N, corresponding to the weight of 35 kg. You do not stay on your feet for
long after being hit by such a jet, although it will probably not hurt you seriously.

Draining cistern. The loss of

Reaction from draining cistern
A cistern with cross section A 0 drains steadily with velocity v through a spout of cross section A
A0
while being continually reﬁlled to maintain a constant water level h above the spout. Assuming nearly ideal
ﬂow, we may use the Toricelli result (16.21) that the outlet speed equals the free-fall speed from height
h, i.e. v ≈ 2g0 h. In the steady state, the required horizontal force on the water is as in the preceding
example,
2
x ≈ ρ0 v A ≈ 2ρ0 g0 Ah.

(23.4)

This force must be ultimately provided by clamps that hold the cistern into place, or by the static friction
between the cistern and the ﬂoor that supports it.
The water moving slowly down through the cistern with vertical velocity v0 = v A/A 0 requires a much
smaller force,

The positive sign can be understood from the fact that the water transports a negative volume ﬂux −v0 A 0
along the z-direction with a negative momentum density −ρ0 v0 . The true vertical reaction force from the
ground on the bottom of the cistern is in this case z + Mg0 where M is the total mass of the cistern plus
water.
Example 23.1.2 (Barrel of wine): With the parameters of the wine barrel (example 16.3.2), i.e.
A ≈ 20 cm2 , A 0 ≈ 0.8 m2 , and h ≈ 2 m, one ﬁnds x ≈ 77 N, corresponding to the weight of almost
8 litres of wine. The vertical force becomes z = 0.2 N which only amounts to the weight of a small
thimbleful of wine.

Around the bend
A pipe with cross section A bends horizontally through an angle θ, and incompressible ﬂuid ﬂows steadily
through the pipe with velocity v. The control volume is chosen to contain all the ﬂuid between inlet and
outlet, leading to a total force
≈ (n2 − n1 )ρ0 v 2 A,

(23.6)

where n1 and n2 are the inlet and outlet directions of the ﬂow. In this case there is also an external force
from the pressure p on the inlet and outlet, such that the true reaction force from the ﬂuid on the inner pipe
surface is,

Ê=−

Although it is always unambiguous what the required total force should be for a ﬁxed control volume in
steady ﬂow, it can sometimes be hard to decide how a piece of equipment will act on the external supports
that keep it in place.
As an illustration we consider a nozzle—the metal device sitting at the end of a ﬁrehose—formed by
narrowing down the cross section of a straight pipe from A 1 to A 2 over a fairly short distance. Mass
conservation guarantees that the same volume ﬂux of liquid goes in and out,

(23.9)

The required external force is positive for A 2 < A 1 and it follows that the ﬁreman, as expected, must push
forward on the nozzle.
For A 1 = A 2 the total force vanishes, and that seems to contradict the common gardening experience
that it is always necessary to hold ﬁrmly on to an open hose (even without nozzle) because it otherwise will
ﬂail back and drench you. So what is the actual extra force that must be applied by the hands that hold a
nozzle when water is pouring out?
The puzzle is resolved when one realizes that a soft but unstretchable hose always meanders through
bends and turns upstream of the nozzle. If, for example, the hose has an unsupported 90 ◦ bend, we ﬁnd by
including the bend in the control volume that the required total force along the nozzle equals the rate of loss
of momentum through the outlet without any contribution from the inlet,

23. REACTION FORCES AND MOMENTS
The explanation is apparently that the moving ﬂuid in the unsupported bend demands an external force
for the bend to remain in place, a force which in this case is transmitted down to the bend from the nozzle
through the unstretchable material of the hose. It is deﬁnitely better to use this value for the purpose of
calculating the required strength of the supports of the nozzle. In the following section we will determine
the true reaction force on the nozzle itself.

S

S0

Example 23.1.4 (Firehose): Older ﬁrehoses with 2.5 inch diameter equipped with a 1.5 inch nozzle
can typically deliver 20–40 litres of water per second. At a rate of 20 litres per second, the required
nozzle force (with a bend) is 350 N which is just about manageable for a single ﬁreﬁghter. A modern
5 inch ﬁrehose can deliver up to 100 litres of water per second through a 3 inch nozzle, leading to a
required force of about 2200 N. This nozzle cannot even be handled by three ﬁreﬁghters, but should be
ﬁrmly anchored in a boat or truck.

S

23.2 Formal deﬁnition of reaction force
In most cases ﬂuid ﬂows in and out of the control volume through well-deﬁned openings which together
constitute a piece S of the control volume surface S. The closed surface is thus composed of two open
parts, S = S0 + S, where S0 is chosen to follow the inside of the ﬂuid conduits.

S
A control volume for a T-junction
containing all the ﬂuid between
the inner conduit walls S0 and the
inlets and outlets S.

Absolute reaction force
The absolute reaction force is deﬁned to be the resultant of all the contact forces that the contents of the
control volume exert on S0 ,

Ê=−

σ · d S.

(23.11)

The surface contribution to the total force (22.17) may now be split into the reaction force plus a part from
the openings S. Using the momentum balance (23.1) we obtain an exact expression for the reaction force,

Ê = − ddt +

(23.12)

The last term (including the sign) represents as before the net momentum ﬂux into the control volume.
Although it in itself is not a true force, momentum balance makes it appear as a contribution to the reaction
force.
Finally, we are able quantitatively to clear up the question of why rockets are said to be reaction-driven.
Choosing the control volume to encompass only the chamber in which the gases burn, the reaction force
that these gases exert on the walls of the chamber is given by the above expression. In this case, the ﬁrst two
terms are tiny because they are proportional to the mass m of the burning gasses, which is normally much
smaller than the mass M of the rocket. The third term can also be disregarded because there is essentially
no stress in the exhaust (at least at subsonic speeds). Thus, for the rocket in vacuum the true reaction force
may to a very good approximation be calculated from the last term in (23.12), representing the net gain of
momentum from the gases expelled through the exhaust nozzle.

It is this reaction force which lifts

Ê Reaction force in steady ﬂow

Several simpliﬁcations are possible in the above expression for the reaction force. In steady ﬂow with
a ﬁxed control volume, the ﬁrst term vanishes, d /dt = 0. Usually the only volume force is constant
gravity g 0 = (0, 0, −g0 ), making the volume integral equal to the weight M g 0 where M is the total mass
of the control volume. Although there may be shear stresses at play in the openings S, they tend to be
small, so the stress tensor may be replaced by the pressure − p in the third term (at least for high Reynolds
number). With these simpliﬁcations the absolute steady-ﬂow reaction force on a ﬁxed control volume may
be written,

23.2. FORMAL DEFINITION OF REACTION FORCE

327

The ﬁrst term is the well-known weight reaction which for incompressible ﬂow is independent of the
velocity and thus equal to the static weight of the ﬂuid. For compressible ﬂow the mass of the ﬂuid could
depend on the velocity of the ﬂow; if, for example, you increase the speed of the gas in a natural gas pipeline
by increasing the inlet pressure, the gas in the pipeline becomes denser and thus weighs more.

Role of the ambient atmosphere
Most machines are immersed in an ambient ‘atmosphere’ of air (or water), which for simplicity is assumed
to be at rest with a hydrostatic pressure distribution p0 . If the ﬁxed control volume were ﬁlled with ambient
ﬂuid at rest, the absolute (and static) reaction force would be,

Ê0 = M0 g0 −

S

p0 d S,

(23.14)

where M0 is the mass of the ambient ﬂuid in the control volume.

relative reaction force becomes,

Evidently, the relative reaction force is obtained by reducing the mass of the ﬂuid by the buoyancy of the

between absolute pressure and the ambient pressure is called the gauge (or gage) pressure, because that is
what you would read on a manometer gauge.
Example 23.2.1 (Gas pipeline): A natural gas pipeline at the bottom of the sea transports gas between
two islands. During construction the engineers allowed sea water to ﬁll the pipeline which rested
comfortably at the bottom under its own weight. But when the system was ﬁlled with gas, the buoyancy
of the displaced water made the pipeline ﬂoat to the surface. The engineers got ﬁred for failing to
correctly calculate the relative reaction force.

Nozzle puzzle, continued
We are now in position to calculate the relative reaction force on the ﬁrehose nozzle discussed on page 325.
Disregarding gravity and taking the outlet pressure equal to the ambient pressure p0 , the relative reaction
force becomes

Êx = ( p − p0 )A1 − ρ0 v2 A2 + ρ0 v1 A1 .

Somewhat surprisingly the ﬂuid appears to exert a positive reaction force on the nozzle along the direction
of ﬂow.
On reﬂection this is in fact in agreement with our expectations because the pressure on the inside of the
nozzle constriction is larger than the ambient pressure surrounding the nozzle. The reaction force Êx is
the force that the ﬁreman would have to oppose, should the hose suddenly break.
Example 23.1.4 (Firehose, continued): For the older ﬁrehose the required handle force will change
instantaneously from +350 N to −200 N if the hose breaks. Since these forces are rather large, there is
a real risk that the ﬁreman will ﬂy off together with the nozzle.

The last term (including the sign) represents the net ﬂux of angular momentum into the control volume
through its surface. It must be emphasized that this term is not a true moment of force acting on the system,
nor the reaction to another moment, but rather a ‘ﬁctitious’ moment akin to the moment created by the
Coriolis force in a rotating frame of reference. As for reaction forces, this term may be shown to contribute
to the true reaction moment although we shall not carry out the analysis here.

The rotor
In turbomachines there is always a solid rotating part, generically called the rotor, which diverts the ﬂow
and either puts energy into the ﬂuid or takes it away. The rotor is usually mounted on a rigid shaft, and the
energy is transmitted to or from the rotor through an external moment of force, or torque, applied to the
shaft. The rotor is carefully designed with a number of channels that guide the ﬂow in and out, and mostly
the channels are constructed from thin blades that obstruct the ﬂow as little as possible. Rotors essentially
only differ in the way their channels are designed. In an axial ﬂow rotor, the channels run along the axis,
and in a radial ﬂow rotor the channels are radial. Rotor design is a highly evolved engineering discipline
and most real turbomachines employ a mixture of axial and radial ﬂow.

Steady ﬂow rotor physics
Even when the rotor spins steadily, the ﬂow in the rotor will strictly speaking be unsteady seen from the
inertial ‘laboratory’ frame because of the moving blades. In the rotating frame of the rotor, the ﬂow will
however be steady, apart from the turbulence that may arise in rapid ﬂow. It is for this reason natural to
choose a rotating control volume which is ﬁxed with respect to the rotor and contains all the ﬂuid in the
rotor.
When the rotor spins with angular velocity around the z-axis, the control volume rotates with velocity
v S = r eφ in the laboratory frame (using cylindrical coordinates with z-axis along the rotor axis). The
ﬂow velocity relative to the rotor is denoted
u = v − vS = v −

r eφ

(23.20)

where v is the ‘absolute’ ﬂow velocity in the non-rotating laboratory frame.
In steady operation the total angular momentum contained in the control volume must be constant,
d /dt = 0, in spite of the fact that it rotates. Using that the speciﬁc angular momentum along the cylinder
axis is (x × v)z = r vφ , the total axial moment of force which has to be exerted by the environment on the
ﬂuid in the rotor is obtained from angular momentum balance (23.19),

Ä

Åz =

S

r vφ ρ u · d S.

(23.21)

The environment may contribute in several ways to this moment, for example through friction as we saw
for the lawn sprinkler, but if friction can be disregarded, Åz will be the moment that must be applied to the
shaft to keep the rotor spinning steadily (and −Åz is the reaction moment from the ﬂuid). In the following
we shall for simplicity assume this is the case.
The total rate of work, or power, that the environment must supply to or take away from the solid shaft
is obtained by multiplying the moment Åz with the angular velocity (see problem 23.3),
P=

Åz .

(23.22)

If the shaft power is positive, the rotor takes energy from the shaft which is put into the ﬂow, as for example
in a hair dryer. If on the other hand the shaft power is negative, the rotor produces energy and acts like a
turbine by taking energy out of the ﬂow.

23.3. REACTION MOMENTS

329

Turbomachines running full of ﬂuid, such as a lawn sprinklers, are driven by pressure differences
between inlets and outlets. Taking only into account the pseudo-gravitational potential −(1/2) 2 r 2 of the
centrifugal force (see equation (7.3)), the general Bernoulli function (16.35) becomes in the rotating frame,
(23.23)
H = 1 u2 − 1 2 r 2 + w( p).
2
2
Here w( p) is the pressure function (16.36), which for incompressible ﬂuids is simply w = p/ρ0 . The
constancy of H along a streamline in nearly ideal steady ﬂow creates a relation between inlet and outlet
pressures. Bernoulli’s theorem should, however, be used with some caution and will not be fulﬁlled if a
signiﬁcant amount of energy is dissipated into heat through turbulence.
Example 23.3.1 (Lawn sprinkler): Returning to the lawn sprinkler in example 22.6.1 on page 315
we now assume that the water feeds into the sprinkler pivot through a 1/2 inch tube. Ignoring the square
of the small inlet velocity (about 2 m s−1 ), Bernoulli’s theorem implies that in the steady state the inlet
pressure excess is
(23.24)
p = p − p0 ≈ 1 ρ0 (U 2 − 2 R 2 ) ≈ 0.5 bar.
0
2
The total power consumed by the sprinkler is determined by the pressure excess (and thus paid for by
the waterworks). It is P0 = p Q/ρ0 ≈ 12 W and mostly goes to supply kinetic energy to the sprinkled
water. The total shaft power (lost to friction) becomes P = −N 0 ≈ −1.3 W which is only a tenth of
the total power consumption.

Radial ﬂow rotor
Radial ﬂow rotors are mostly used in high-pressure turbomachinery, such as pumps, compressors and
hydraulic turbines. Although the following analysis concerns a turbine, it is also valid for a pump. We
assume that the ﬂow is effectively incompressible and nearly ideal.
Let the rotor have inner radius a, outer radius b and axial length L. We shall for simplicity assume that
it is perfectly cylindrical with the same properties along the whole of its length 0 < z < L, such that the
channels have the same shape for all z. In a turbine, high-speed water is fed in at the outer perimeter r = b
with (negative) radial velocity u r (b) = vr (b) and removed at the inner perimeter r = a with (negative)
radial velocity u r (a) = vr (a). In a pump the radial velocities are positive. Disregarding the blocking from
the thin blades separating the otherwise identical channels, the total volume ﬂux is approximately,
Q = 2πaLu r (a) = 2πbLu r (b).

(23.25)

The integral in the shaft moment (23.21) only receives contributions from the radial surfaces at r = a, b.
Since vφ is approximatively independent of φ and z, we ﬁnd from (23.22) the shaft power (Euler’s turbine
equation),
P = (b vφ (b) − a vφ (a))ρ0 Q.

(23.26)

For a turbine where Q is negative, the shaft power will be negative as long as the angular momentum
density is larger at the entry than at the exit, b vφ (b) > a vφ (a). The ﬂuid understandably has to lose
angular momentum for the rotor to produce the work that may drive an electric generator. In a pump, it is
the other way around.
The rotor consists of a number of thin blades mounted radially on a hub like the spokes of a wheel.
Let the rotor blades be designed such that the geometric slopes with respect to the radial direction are αa at
r = a and αb at r = b. In smooth operation we assume that the steady ﬂow enters and leaves tangentially
along the blades. Although a rotor can still operate if this condition is not fulﬁlled, it is much more liable
to generate turbulence and even cavitation accompanied by loss of power, because of the sudden change in
ﬂow direction, especially at the entry. The smoothness condition provides the following relations between
the relative radial and azimuthal velocities,
u φ (a) = αa u r (a),

u φ (b) = αb u r (b).

(23.27)

Using that the absolute azimuthal velocity is vφ (r ) = u φ (r ) + r , and eliminating the azimuthal velocities
by means of these equations and the radial velocities by means of mass conservation (23.25), we obtain

Example 23.3.2 (Hydraulic turbine): A large hydraulic turbine is driven by water piped down from
a reservoir h = 110 m above the turbine. The rotor axis is vertical and the inner and outer radii are
a = 2 m and b = 3 m. The axial length is L = 0.5 m, and the rotor rotates at 60 rpm, i.e. once per
second or
= 2π s−1 . The blades are constructed with vanishing entry slope αb = 0, so that the
azimuthal inlet velocity is vφ (b) = b ≈ 19 m s−1 . At the exit the slope is chosen to be αa = 1/3,
and the ﬂow is required to be purely radial, vφ (a) = 0, leading to u r (a) = − a/αa ≈ −38 m s−1 and
u r (b) = au r (a)/b ≈ −25 m s−1 . The absolute inlet velocity of the water becomes v(b) ≈ 31 m s−1 ,
corresponding to a free-fall from 50 m height. The ﬂux of water may now be calculated from (23.25)
and becomes Q ≈ −237 m3 s−1 . The total shaft power (23.28) is P ≈ −84 MW. The pressure drop
through the turbine is about p = p(b)− p(a) ≈ 5.7 bar which is a bit more than half the static pressure
head from the reservoir. The total rate of work of the excess pressure is P0 = p Q ≈ 136 MW, so
the shaft work of the turbine is about P/P0 ≈ 62% of the total work of the water. The remainder is
found in the kinetic energy of the water coming out of the turbine at higher speed than it entered. In this
calculation we have disregarded losses due to friction and turbulence which can be quite signiﬁcant.

The ﬁrst term is due to the centrifugal force and the second to the change in velocity through the rotor
channel. If the slopes are of nearly equal magnitudes, |αa | ≈ |αb | both terms will be positive, so the
pressure will always be largest at the outer rim of the rotor. This is the pressure head which drives a
hydraulic turbine powered by high-pressure water coming down from a reservoir. Conversely, this must
also be the pressure head created by the pump used to lift water up into a reservoir.

Axial ﬂow rotor
Axial ﬂow rotors are typically used in high-volume turbomachinery, such as fans and low-pressure turbines.
The ﬂuid is also in this case taken to be nearly ideal and effectively incompressible with constant density,
ρ = ρ0 . Since there is no radial ﬂow in this design, mass conservation guarantees that the axial velocity
vz = vz (r ) is independent of z. The rotor is assumed to be cylindrical with inner and outer radii a and b,
and thin blades that do not signiﬁcantly obstruct the ﬂow. The ﬂuid enters the rotor at z = z 1 and leaves at
z = z 2 . We shall for simplicity assume that the axial ﬂow is uniform vz = U , so that the total volume ﬂux
through the rotor becomes
Q=

b
a

vz (r ) 2πr dr = U A,

(23.30)

where A = π(b2 − a 2 ) is the area of the axial rotor cross section.
The rotor channels change the azimuthal velocity ﬁeld vφ (r, z). The integral in the shaft moment
(23.21) only receives contributions from the inlet at z = z 1 and the outlet at z = z 2 , so the shaft power
becomes
P=

In the last step we have expressed the integral in terms of the area average f = (1/A) a f (r )2πr dr
over the cross section of the rotor. The shaft power is positive if the azimuthal speed generally increases
through the rotor, as one would expect.

In steady operation we assume that the ﬂow enters and leaves the spinning rotor tangentially along the
blades. The rotor blades are designed such that the slope with respect to the z -axis is α1 (r ) at the entrance
and α2 (r ) at the exit. Since the relative azimuthal rotor speed is u φ = vφ − r , the smoothness condition
amounts to,
u φ 1 = vφ 1 − r = α1 U,

u φ 2 = vφ 2 − r = α2 U.

(23.32)

Using these relations to eliminate the azimuthal velocities, the shaft power may be written

(23.33)

The slope average r (α2 − α1 ) is a purely geometric factor which is independent of both U and
Note that this expression is only valid if the smoothness condition is actually fulﬁlled.

.

If the inlet and exit slopes are the same α1 = α2 , the total shaft power appears to vanish. This seems
a bit puzzling, because it is well known that propellers with ﬂat blades also require engine power
to turn steadily. The explanation is that for such devices the smoothness condition is not fulﬁlled,
and the ﬂuid hits the propeller blades at an ‘angle of attack’, resulting in aerodynamic forces which
oppose the motion and thus require power in the steady state (aerodynamic forces are discussed at
length in chapter 29).
The actual geometric design of the blades provides us with the slopes. Here we shall for simplicity only
consider the case in which the blades have slopes that grow proportionally with the radial distance r , i.e.
α1 = β1 r and α2 = β2r . Under this assumption, the ﬂuid will rotate like a solid body with vφ1 = 1 r at
the entrance and vφ2 = 2r at the exit, where the smoothness condition determines the angular velocities,
1=

+ β1 U,

2 =

+ β2 U.

(23.34)

Now the shaft power (23.33) can be calculated explicitly with the result
P = 1 (a 2 + b2 )(β2 − β1 )ρ0 U Q.
2

(23.35)

If the blades are not designed with uniformly growing slopes, this expression may still be used for the
purpose of doing estimates.
Finally, the pressure change through the rotor is obtained from the Bernoulli function (23.23) in the rest
system of the rotor. For a streamline at constant r passing through an axial channel from inlet to outlet we

(23.36)

The pressure difference between inlet and outlet grows in this case with the square of the distance of the
channel from the axis.
Axial ﬂow turbines are often provided with upstream guide vanes to add an initial azimuthal spin 1
to the ﬂuid before it enters the rotor. The guide vanes have basically the same function as the rotor blades,
but since they are solidly anchored to the housing of the machine the reaction moment from the ﬂuid on
the guide vanes have no inﬂuence on the shaft power. For axial ﬂow blowers, downstream guide vanes may
similarly be used to ‘straighten out’ the rotating ﬂuid before it exits from the blower.
Example 23.3.3 (Air blower): In longer road tunnels axial ﬂow air blowers are often used to create
an artiﬁcial draught along the tunnel in order to rid it of exhaust fumes, especially when trafﬁc has
stalled. Suppose an air blower with outer diameter 2b = 60 cm and hub diameter 2a ≈ 20 cm operates
at
= 600 rpm = 10 × 2π s−1 . The blades are constructed with radially increasing slopes, and
the maximal entrance angle at the tip of a blade is −45 ◦ , corresponding to α1 (b) = −1 and thus
β1 = α1 (b)/b ≈ −3.33 m−1 . At the entrance the air has no spin, 1 = 0, and the axial ﬂow becomes

Rotor scaling relations
Although one may estimate the overall behaviour of a rotor from angular momentum balance and
Bernoulli’s theorem, the details of the ﬂow pattern through the actual rotor and the unavoidable viscosity
of the ﬂuid will give rise to important corrections to the shaft power and the pressure jump across the rotor,
corrections that may not be easily calculable from theory. Model studies of scaled down versions of the
rotor may, however, be feasible and the measured values of shaft power and pressure jump can afterwards
be scaled up to yield a prediction for the actual machinery. So we need to know the scaling relations for
these quantities.
A rotor of a given design is characterized by a single length scale D, the ‘diameter’ of the system. The
ﬂuid itself is characterized by its density ρ at some point, say at the inlet. We shall furthermore assume
that the viscosity is so small that it can be disregarded. During steady operation of the rotor, the controlling
parameters are the angular velocity and volume ﬂux Q. Since D controls the length scale, the time
scale, the only dimensionless parameter which can be constructed is,
q=

Q
.
D3

(23.37)

It may be viewed as a dimensionless representation of the volume ﬂux and is usually called the ﬂow
coefﬁcient. It also represents the ratio q ∼ u/v between the relative ﬂow velocity u ∼ Q/D 2 and the
absolute velocity v ∼ D.
From (23.21) and (23.22) it follows that the shaft power scales like P ∼ Dvρ0 Q ∼ 2 D 2 ρ0 Q.
Similarly, it follows from (23.23) that the pressure head scales like p ∼ (1/2)ρ0 2 D 2 . The exact
equations of ﬂuid mechanics (without viscosity) must therefore provide relationships of the form

(23.38)

where f (q) and g(q) are—generally unknown—dimensionless functions of the dimensionless control
variable q. For a radial rotor with nearly ideal incompressible ﬂow, we take D = b and ﬁnd from (23.28)

If viscosity is important, f and g will also depend on the Reynolds number.
Example 23.3.4 (Model turbine): For the hydraulic turbine of example 23.3.2 we take D = b and
ﬁnd q = 1.4. A model turbine scaled down by a factor of 10, i.e. with D → 0.1D, but operated
at the same angular velocity
and the same value of q has a thousand times smaller volume ﬂux
Q → 10−3 Q. The scaling relations now imply that P → 10−5 P and p → 10−2 p, independent of
the form of the generally unknown functions f and g. Measuring the values of P and p in the model
turbine immediately allows us to infer the values for the full-scale turbine (the Reynolds numbers will,
however, be different for turbine and model).

Surface waves in the sea are created by the interaction of wind and water which somehow transforms the
steady motion of the streaming air into the nearly periodic swelling and subsiding of the water. The waves
appear to roll towards the coast in fairly orderly sequence of crests and troughs that is translated into the
quick ebb and ﬂow of water at the beach, so well known to all of us. On top of that there is, of course, the
slow ebb and ﬂow of the tides.
In constant ‘ﬂat-Earth’ gravity, the interface between two ﬂuids at rest is always horizontal. In moving
ﬂuids the interface can take a very complex instantaneous shape under the simultaneous inﬂuence of inertia,
pressure, gravity, container shape, surface tension and viscosity. Waves controlled by pressure and gravity
are naturally called gravity waves, whereas waves controlled by pressure and surface tension are called
capillary waves. If the ﬂuids have vastly different densities, as is the case for the sea and the atmosphere,
one may often disregard the lighter ﬂuid and instead consider the open surface of the heavier ﬂuid against
vacuum. For ﬂuids of nearly equal density, for example a saline bottom layer in the sea overlayed with a
brackish layer, internal gravity waves driven by pressure and buoyancy may arise in the interface.
This chapter is devoted to the various types of small-amplitude surface waves and the conditions under
which they occur (see [42, 67, 1, 22, 36] for extended discussions of surface waves). Mathematically, smallamplitude waves are by far the easiest to deal with. More interesting and unusual wave types arise when
amplitudes grow so large that the nonlinear aspects of ﬂuid mechanics come into play. Nonlinear waves
are common everyday occurrences, from the familiar run-up of waves on a beach to the less familiar sonic
boom from an aircraft overhead, but the subject of truly nonlinear waves is unfortunately so mathematically
challenging that we shall only treat its simpler aspects here (chapter 25).

24.1 Basic physics of surface waves
The shape of an interface between two ﬂuids in hydrostatic equilibrium is determined by the balance
between the pressure gradient and gravity throughout the interior of the ﬂuids (chapter 7). Surface tension
may also have profound inﬂuence on the shape of small ﬂuid volumes, for example a raindrop (chapter 8).
What we shall call waves in this chapter are time-dependent disturbances of a ﬂuid interface originally in
hydrostatic equilibrium.
Although surface waves may occur wherever material properties change, we shall mostly think of
gravity waves. In constant gravity, the hydrostatic interface between the sea and the air is ﬂat and horizontal,
usually taken to be z = 0 in a ﬂat-Earth coordinate system. A wave will disturb the surface so that its

A surface wave in the ﬂat-Earth
coordinate system.

z = h(x, y, t).

(24.1)

Our interest will mainly focus on trains of waves that progress periodically and in a regular pattern across
the horizontal surface of the sea, although everyday experience tells us that waves can be much more
complicated. In a breaking wave, the surface height is not even a single-valued function of position.
Waves can be created in many ways. The splash you make when you jump bottom-ﬁrst into a swimming
pool creates ﬁrst a single large ring-shaped wave, perhaps followed by several smaller waves. When these
waves hit the edge of the pool they are reﬂected and interfere with themselves to create quite chaotic
patterns. In this chapter we shall, however, not be concerned much with the mechanisms by which waves
are created, but rather with their internal dynamics after they have somehow been brought into existence.

Wave parameters

Any non-breaking surface wave consists locally of mounds and hollows of roughly the same size in the
otherwise smooth equilibrium surface. Although a general wave can be very complex, it is convenient to
describe these local features in terms of parameters that are normally reserved for harmonic waves:

• a—amplitude. It sets the scale for vertical variations in the height of the wave. Mostly it is taken to
be the height of a mound above the equilibrium level, or equivalently the depth of a hollow below.

d

A general wave consists of
mounds and hollows. Locally,
the amplitude a is related to the
vertical distance between maxima and minima, the wavelength
λ to the horizontal size of a
mound or hollow, and the period τ to the time scale for major changes in the local pattern.
The depth d is the average vertical distance to the bottom.

• λ—wavelength. This is the horizontal length scale of the wave, typically related to the width of a
mound or a hollow.
• τ —period. A measure of the time scale for major changes in the wave pattern, for example the time
it takes for a mound to become a hollow.
• d—depth. The vertical distance to a solid boundary, the ‘bottom’.
The ratio c = λ/τ is called the celerity or phase velocity of the wave, and characterizes the speed with
which the waveform changes shape.
If the wavelength is much greater than the depth, λ
d, we shall speak about long waves or more
graphically shallow-water waves. Similarly, waves with wavelength much smaller than the depth, λ
d,
are called short waves or deep-water waves. Waves with amplitude much smaller than both wavelength and
depth, a
λ, d, are called small-amplitude waves.

A ‘waterberg’ of height a and
width λ rising out of a sea of
depth d. When the waterberg
collapses vertically, all the water
in it has to disperse in the
horizontal directions.

In a gravity wave the force of gravity pulls the water of a mound downwards and sets it into motion, and
this motion may in turn make the water rise again. Whereas the potential energy of the wave only depends
on its shape, the kinetic energy also depends on the ﬂow velocities in the wave, and thus on the period.
Therefore, if no energy is lost to friction, this continual conversion of potential energy into kinetic energy
and back must provide a relation between the period of a wave and the other parameters,
τ = τ (a, λ, d, . . .).

(24.2)

The precise form of this dispersion law for a particular type of wave is normally obtained from careful
analysis of the wave dynamics, several examples of which will be given later. Here we shall only make a
coarse estimate of the general form of the dispersion law using that potential and kinetic energies must be
of comparable magnitudes.

Collapse of a ‘waterberg’
Suppose we have somehow created a mound of water, instantaneously at rest, for example by pulling an
inverted water-ﬁlled bucket up through the ﬂat surface of the sea. Common experience tells us that such a
‘waterberg’ will quickly collapse into the sea, creating instead a smaller and wider hollow which may later
rise again to make an even smaller mound that in turn collapses, and so on. Eventually all traces of the
initial mound will have disappeared into secondary waves running away over the surface.

24.1. BASIC PHYSICS OF SURFACE WAVES

337

Let the initial mound have height a and width λ so that its volume is of magnitude λ2 a. During the ﬁrst
collapse all the water in the mound will move vertically downwards and reach the sea level in characteristic
time τ . Since water is incompressible, an equal volume has to move horizontally away from the collapse
region with a typical speed U . For long waves with λ
d, the proximity of the bottom forces all the water
underneath the mound to move away horizontally. Mass conservation tells us that the volume of the mound
equals the volume that streams away over a period, or λ2 a ∼ λd U τ . Solving for U we ﬁnd,
U∼

aλ
.
τd

(24.3)

Since the typical vertical speed is a/τ , the horizontal ﬂow velocity U in a shallow sea will be much greater
than the vertical by a factor λ/d
1. For short waves with λ
d, there is no bottom to divert the water
ﬂow so that the horizontal velocity tends to be of same order of magnitude as the vertical, i.e. U ∼ a/τ near
the surface. From the expression for U , one may thus conclude that the deep sea may be characterized by
an effective depth of the same magnitude as the wavelength, d ∼ λ. These claims will be conﬁrmed later
by precise calculations, showing in fact that the effective depth of the deep sea is d ≈ λ/2π.
The potential energy of the initial mound relative to the general level of the sea is of magnitude,

Î ∼ ρ0 λ2 a · g0 a = ρ0 g0 a2 λ2 .

(24.4)

Interestingly, a hollow of depth a and width λ would have a potential energy of the same magnitude, for the
simple reason that buoyancy presses the surface upward, like the hull of a ship.
The kinetic energy in the horizontal motion of the collapsing water mound becomes of magnitude

(24.6)

Note that the amplitude fell out of this expression. The dispersion law is merely a coarse estimate of
the overall magnitude of the collapse time. It may still be multiplied by an unknown factor of order unity
which can depend on the dimensionless ratios a/λ and d/λ, and possibly on other dimensionless parameters
characterizing the actual shape of the wave.
From the dispersion law we immediately get the phase velocity

(24.7)

Like an echo of Toricelli’s law (page 210) it is of the same order of magnitude as the free-fall velocity
2g0 d from height d. In shallow water where d is the true depth of the sea, the phase velocity is
independent of wavelength. In deep water where the true depth is inﬁnite, the effective depth may as
pointed out above be taken to be d ≈ λ/2π.
Example 24.1.1 (Inverted bucket): A little ‘waterberg’ created by lifting an inverted bucket of height
a = 30 cm and width λ = 50 cm out of water of depth d = 1 m collapses in just τ ∼ 0.15 s.

Gravity waves are nearly ideal
The shape of a surface wave is only a manifestation of the underlying hydrodynamics, governed by the
Navier–Stokes equations. From the estimate (24.3) of the horizontal ﬂow velocity we estimate the Reynolds
number in shallow water to be,

24. SMALL-AMPLITUDE SURFACE WAVES
Here we have assumed that the advective acceleration is dominated by fast horizontal motion over a length
scale λ, whereas the viscous acceleration is dominated by the vertical variation in the horizontal ﬂow over
the depth d . For deep-water waves d may as before be replaced by λ/2π .
The typical sea waves we encounter when swimming close to the shore at a depth of a couple of
metres have amplitudes up to a metre and periods of some seconds. With ν ≈ 10−6 m2 s−1 for water, the
Reynolds number will be in the millions, and viscosity plays essentially no role for such waves. In daily life
we are otherwise quite familiar with viscous waves, for example while stirring porridge, but they are not
so interesting because they quickly die out. Nearly ideal gravity waves in water simply keep rolling along.
Eventually viscosity will also make these waves die away if left on their own, but that problem can be dealt
with separately (see section 24.6).

Small-amplitude waves are nearly linear
The nonlinearity of the equations of ﬂuid mechanics makes surface waves much more complex than,
for example, electromagnetic waves governed by the linear Maxwell equations. The nonlinear advective
acceleration of the ﬂuid (v ·∇)v can however often be disregarded in comparison with the local acceleration
∂v/∂ t , so that the Navier–Stokes equations also become linear. For shallow-water waves we obtain the ratio
of advective to local acceleration,
|(v · ∇)v|

(24.9)

Quite generally we can conclude that the advective term plays no role for small-amplitude waves with
a
d (and d ≈ λ/2π in deep water). In short: the Navier–Stokes equations become linear in the smallamplitude limit.
The most general solution to a set of linear ﬁeld equations with constant coefﬁcients is a linear
superposition of elementary harmonic solutions (possibly damped). We have seen this for small-amplitude
vibrations in solids (chapter 14) as well as for small-amplitude pressure waves in ﬂuids (section 17.6). In
these cases the three-dimensional waves are superpositions of elementary plane waves, each of which at
any given time has constant physical properties in any plane orthogonal to its direction of propagation. The
same will be the case for the ﬂow (literally) underlying small-amplitude surface waves.

A periodic line wave on the
surface. The crests are parallel
lines orthogonal to the vector n =
(cos θ, sin θ, 0), forming an angle

Three-dimensional plane waves have identical physical properties in every plane orthogonal to the direction
of propagation. Surface waves are two-dimensional, and elementary harmonic surface waves have the same
physical properties on any line orthogonal to the direction of propagation. A harmonic line wave is of the
form
h = a cos(k x x + k y y − ωt + χ)

(24.10)

where k = (k x , k y , 0) is the wave vector, k = |k| = 2π/λ the wavenumber, ω = 2π/τ the circular
frequency and χ the phase shift. The argument of the cosine, φ = k x x + k y y − ωt + χ, is called the
phase of the wave. The phase shift can for a single wave always be absorbed in the choice of origin of
the coordinate system or of time, but differences between phase shifts may become of physical importance
when waves are superposed.
The maxima or minima, or crests and troughs as they are called for surface waves, move steadily along
in the direction n = k/k = (cos θ, sin θ, 0) with the phase velocity,

(24.11)

For small-amplitude shallow-water waves where the dispersion law is linear, the phase velocity is
independent of the wavenumber k. In general, however, the dispersion law will be nonlinear, τ = τ (λ)
or equivalently ω = ω(k), as we saw for deep-water waves, and the phase velocity will depend on the
wavenumber.

into a ‘beat pattern’ of wave packets of length 2π/ k = 1 centred at x = n for all integer n.

Group velocity
Consider now two harmonic line waves which for simplicity are chosen to run along the x-axis with the
same amplitudes. Their phases are φ1 = k1 x − ω1 t + χ1 and φ2 = k2 x − ω2 t + χ2 , and using the

(24.13)

where k = (k1 + k2 )/2 etc are the average quantities for the two waves, and k = k1 − k2 etc are the
differences. The ﬁrst oscillating factor evidently describes a line wave moving along the x-axis with the
average values of the wavenumbers, frequencies and phase shifts, but the amplitude of this wave is now
modulated by the second factor.
|k|, | ω|
|ω|, and | χ|
|χ|, the
If the differences are much smaller than the averages, | k|
second cosine factor will only slowly modulate the rapid oscillations of the ﬁrst. Since the second cosine
vanishes when its arguments pass through (1/2)π + nπ where n is an arbitrary integer, it will chop the
average wave up into a string of wave packets of typical length L = 2π/ | k|, as pictured in ﬁgure 24.1.
Inside each wave packet, the crests will move with the phase velocity c = ω/k, whereas the centre of each
wave packet will move with the speed ω/ k = (ω(k1 )−ω(k2 ))/ k ≈ dω(k)/dk. Thus, the propagation
speed of a wave packet is given by the derivative of the dispersion law,
cg =

dω
,
dk

(24.14)

also called the group velocity.
Any superposition of waves with nearly equal wave vectors will in fact form one or more wave packets
moving with the group velocity (see problem 24.7). If the dispersion law is linear, the group and phase
velocities are equal, but if the dispersion law is nonlinear they will be different, and the waves are said to
be dispersive. If the group velocity is smaller than the phase velocity, cg < c, the wave crests will move
forward inside a wave packet as it proceeds across the surface, and conversely if it is larger.

Energy transport and group velocity
In a single wave packet, the velocity ﬁeld is only non-zero in the region covered by the wave packet, so that
the energy of the wave must be concentrated here and transported along the surface with the group velocity,
rather than with the phase velocity. The same must be true for any superposition of single wave packets
with wavenumbers taken from a narrow band of width k around k, such as the one shown in ﬁgure 24.1.

A single Gaussian wave packet.

340

24. SMALL-AMPLITUDE SURFACE WAVES
In the limit where the bandwidth k narrows down to nothing, the energy must still be transported with the
group velocity, so in the end we reach the slightly strange conclusion that even in a purely monofrequent
line wave the energy must be transported with the group velocity (see page 356).

the advective term,

where g = (0, 0, −g0 ). These equations do not explicitly involve the surface height, which will only come
in via the boundary conditions.

Boundary conditions
At the open surface, z = h , there are two boundary conditions which must be fulﬁlled. The ﬁrst is purely
kinematic and expresses that a ﬂuid particle sitting on the surface should follow the surface motion. Under
the assumption of small amplitudes, a
d, λ, the surface is nearly horizontal everywhere, so that the
vertical velocity of the ﬂuid just below the surface should equal the vertical velocity of the surface itself,

The second boundary condition is dynamic and expresses the continuity of the pressure across the surface.
Assuming that there is air or vacuum with constant pressure p0 above the surface, the condition becomes

for z = h.

(24.17)

Here we have disregarded surface tension which would add a contribution to the right-hand side (see section
24.4).
Besides these, there will be further boundary conditions depending on the shape of the container.

Velocity potential
The linearized Euler equation (24.15) shows that the time derivative of the velocity ﬁeld ∂v/∂t is a gradient
ﬁeld. Thus, if the velocity ﬁeld is initially a gradient ﬁeld, it will keep on being one. In view of the linearity,
the most general solution to the ﬁeld equations is an irrotational (gradient) ﬁeld superposed with a timeindependent ﬁeld, possibly containing vorticity. Such a ﬁeld is of no interest for the study of wave motion,
and we shall from now on focus on the time-dependent irrotational component and write it as the gradient
of the velocity potential ,
v=∇

(24.18)

which, due to the divergence condition, has to satisfy Laplace’s equation,
∇2

= 0.

(24.19)

Inserting the gradient ﬁeld into the ﬁeld equation and solving for the pressure, we ﬁnd the general solution,
p = p0 − ρ0 g0 z +

∂

(24.20)

We might, in principle, add an arbitrary function of time to the right-hand side, but such a function could,
without loss of generality, be absorbed into . Taking z = h we now obtain the open surface boundary
conditions,

Applied to the solutions of the Laplace equation (24.19), these conditions determine both (x, t) and
h(x, y, t), and from (24.20) the pressure may be found. Since all terms of higher order in h have been left
out, one may in this approximation take z = 0 rather than z = h on the right-hand sides of these conditions.

Figure 24.2. Phase and group velocities of deep-water waves as a function of wavelength. This ﬁgure
corresponds to the small-wavelength part of ﬁgure 24.3. Typical ocean swells have wavelengths of
λ ≈ 150 m, phase velocity c ≈ 15 m s−1 ≈ 55 km h−1 and group velocity equal to half of this. Closer to
the coast the waves slow down because the water gets shallower (see ﬁgure 24.3).

Harmonic line wave solution
Suppose now that the surface wave is an elementary harmonic line wave,
h = a cos(kx − ωt)

(24.22)

and that the ﬂow underneath is independent of y. From the ﬁrst of the conditions (24.21), it follows that
∇z = aω sin(kx − ωt) for z = h, and this suggests that the velocity potential at all depths will be of the
form,
= f (z) sin(kx − ωt),

(24.23)

where f (z) is a so far unknown function of z. The Laplace equation (24.18) takes here the form

∇z = −∇x and leads immediately to f = k 2 f . The most general solution to this equation is
f (z) = Aekz + Be−kz

(24.24)

where A and B are constants to be determined from the boundary conditions.

Deep-water waves
In deep water the velocity ﬁeld must be ﬁnite for z → −∞, implying that B = 0 so that f (z) = Aekz . The
open surface boundary conditions (24.21) now lead to,
aω sin(kx − ωt) = k Aekh sin(kx − ωt),
g0 a cos(kx − ωt) = ω Aekh cos(kx − ωt).
In a small-amplitude wave, the wave height is small compared to the wavelength, k |h|
1, so that ekh ≈ 1

The dispersive nature of deep-water waves have important consequences. A local surface disturbance
in deep water—for example created by a storm far out at sea—usually contains more than one
wavelength. The long-wave components are faster and will run ahead to arrive at the beach maybe
a day or so before the slower short-wave components. The separation of wavelengths over long
distances also causes the waves that arrive on the beach to be nearly monofrequent, rolling in at
regular time intervals which slowly become shorter as the smaller wavelengths take over.

(24.28d)

The horizontal and vertical velocity components have the same scale, aω = 2πa/τ , but are 90 ◦ out of
phase. The ﬂuid particles move through orbits that are approximatively circles of radius aekz at depth z.
Due to the exponential, a deep-water surface wave only inﬂuences the ﬂow to a depth |z| ≈ 1/k =
λ/2π. What happens at the bottom has no inﬂuence on the surface waves, as long as the wavelength
satisﬁes λ
2πd.

Harmonic line waves at ﬁnite depth
When wavelengths become comparable to the depth of the ocean, we must take into account the shape of
the bottom. For a horizontally inﬁnite ocean with a perfectly ﬂat impermeable bottom at constant depth
z = −d, the only extra condition is that the vertical velocity should vanish at the bottom,
vz = 0

for z = −d.

(24.29)

In the absence of viscosity, we are not at liberty to impose a no-slip condition on the horizontal velocities.
The ﬂat-bottom boundary condition implies that f (−d) = 0, or Ae−kd = Bekd , so that we have
f (z) = C cosh k(z + d)

(24.30)

where C is another constant. As for deep-water waves, it is determined by the open surface boundary

The horizontal velocity is the same for all z, so that all the water underneath sloshes back and forth in
unison as the wave proceeds. The vertical velocity decreases and reaches zero at the bottom, as it must (this
is the reason for keeping the second-order terms in ). At any depth z, the pressure is just the hydrostatic
pressure from the water column above, including the height of the wave.
The horizontal velocity scale, c a/d = λa/τ d, equals precisely the previously estimated shallow-water
value (24.3) which is larger than the vertical velocity scale aω = 2πa/τ by a factor λ/2πd. This also
conﬁrms the estimates made in section 24.1.
Example 24.3.1 (Tsunami): Huge shallow-water wave trains, tsunamis (meaning harbour waves), with
wavelengths up to 500 km can be generated by underwater earthquakes, landslides, volcanic eruptions
or large meteorite impacts. The average depth of the oceans is about 4000 m so tsunamis move with
typical speeds of a passenger jet plane, c ≈ 200 m s−1 ≈ 710 km h−1 , at that depth, and faster at
greater depths. For λ = 500 km the period becomes τ = λ/c ≈ 2500 s ≈ 42 min, but since the
amplitude is small, say a ≈ 1 m, a tsunami will be completely imperceptible to a ship at sea (today
the precision of GPS positioning should make it notable). When the tsunami approaches the coastline,
the water depth decreases and the wave slows down while increasing its amplitude with sometimes
devastating effect on the shore.

The small rectangle in the x yplane deﬁnes a piece of the wave
surface of area A = x y.

Surface tension is characterized by a material constant α, representing the attractive force per unit of length
of the surface, or equivalently the extra energy per unit of surface area (from the missing molecular bonds).
Surface tension generates a pressure jump (8.5) across any interface between two ﬂuids, expressed through
the principal radii of curvature of the surface. We saw in section 8.1 that the relative inﬂuence of surface
tension and gravity in a liquid/air interface is characterized by a length (8.4), called the capillary constant,
√
which is Rc = α/ρ0 g0 ≈ 2.7 mm for the water/air interface. Surface tension only plays a major role for
length scales smaller than the capillary constant.

Pressure jump across a nearly ﬂat surface
To calculate the pressure jump over a nearly ﬂat surface, z = h(x, y) with |∂h/∂ x| , |∂h/∂ y|
1, we
consider a tiny piece of the surface situated above a small rectangle between (x, y) and (x + x, y + y).
All four sides of this piece of surface are subject to tension from the surrounding surface, and we wish to

calculate the resultant vertical force. Since the slope of the surface is small, we may disregard the slight
misalignment between the vertical force and the pressure force which strictly speaking must be orthogonal
to the surface. The slope of the surface at (x, y) is ∂h/∂ x along x, and it follows from the geometry that
the surface tension acting on the two y-sides of the rectangle generates a ‘vertical’ force,

(24.39)

(24.40)

Since p given by (24.39) is positive at a wave crest and negative at a trough, surface tension collaborates
with gravity in attempting to ﬂatten the water surface. Waves completely dominated by surface tension are
called capillary waves.

Deep-water capillary gravity waves
Surface tension is only expected to become important for waves of very small wavelength, which except
for special situations may be assumed to be deep-water waves. The velocity potential is in that case
= Aekz sin(kx − ωt), and from the kinematic boundary condition (24.16) and the modiﬁed dynamic
boundary condition (24.40) we obtain in the usual way,

If the surface curves downwards in all directions at a given point, we have (∇x + ∇ y )h < 0, and the extra
pressure will be positive below the surface.
The curvature of a small-amplitude surface wave thus generates a pressure jump p at the surface.
Whereas the Euler equation (24.15) is unchanged, the value of the pressure just below the surface is p0 + p
rather than p0 , so that the dynamic boundary condition (24.17) is replaced by,

p = p0 +

Adding the forces acting on the two x-sides and dividing by the area A = x y, we see that in order to
balance the vertical force from surface tension, the pressure just below the surface must be higher by,

has a minimum at λ ≈ 2.54λc (see problem 24.2).

24.5 Internal waves
In the ocean a heavier saline layer of water may often be found below a lighter more brackish layer, allowing
so-called internal waves to arise at the interface. Even if the difference in density between the ﬂuids is
small, the equilibrium interface will always be horizontal with the lighter liquid situated above the heavier
(as discussed previously in section 7.1). Were it somehow possible to invert the ocean so that the lighter
ﬂuid came to lie below the heavier, instability would surely arise, and the liquids would after some time ﬁnd
their way back to ‘natural’ order. As we shall see, surface tension can in fact stabilize the inverted situation
in sufﬁciently small containers.

Boundary conditions
Let the lower layer have density ρ1 and the upper layer ρ2 with a separating interface z = h(x, y, t) between
the two ﬂuids, for which the velocity potentials are 1 and 2 . The kinematic boundary conditions for
small-amplitude waves express that both ﬂuids and the separating surface must move together in the vertical
direction,

v1z = v2z =
∂t

for z = h.

(24.46)

Including surface tension (24.39), the dynamic boundary condition becomes,
p1 +
where

p = p2

for z = h

(24.47)

p is given by (24.39), and the pressures are expressed like (24.20) in each of the ﬂuids.

Dispersion law
Suppose again that the interface takes the form of a pure line wave, h = a cos(kx − ωt). We shall
only consider deep-water waves in which the wave ﬂow is required to vanish far below and far above
the interface. The velocity potentials are then of the form,

with a notable change of sign in the exponential factors. The boundary conditions (24.46) and (24.47) imply
for k |h|

ρ1 (g0 a − ω A 1 ) + αk 2 a = ρ2 (g0 a − ω A 2 ).

It diverges when the densities become equal. In this limit gravity plays no role, and the internal waves have
become purely capillary waves, described by (24.45) with ρ0 = 2ρ1 = 2ρ2 .
Example 24.5.1 (Brackish–saline interface in the sea):
If a brackish surface layer lies above
a saline layer with 4% higher density, the capillary wavelength for internal waves becomes λc =
2π Rc = 8.6 cm. A wave with this wavelength has period τ = 1.2 s and moves with phase velocity
c = 7.2 cm s−1 .

The Rayleigh–Taylor instability
When the heavier ﬂuid lies below the lighter, ρ1 > ρ2 , the frequency ω of an internal wave is always real,
but if the container is quickly turned upside down, such that ρ1 < ρ2 , the heavier ﬂuid will be on top and
the dispersion law may be written as,

The argument of the square root will be negative for k Rc < 1, or λ > λc = 2π Rc . In that case, ω becomes
imaginary, and the otherwise sinusoidal form, the line wave, is replaced by an exponential growth e|ω|t in
time. This signals an instability, called the Rayleigh–Taylor instability.
In an inﬁnitely extended ocean, there is room for waves with wavelengths of any size, and the inverted
situation will always be unstable. It can only be maintained for a very short while, because the smallest
perturbation of the surface will lead to a run-away process that ends with the heavier liquid again arranged
below the lighter.
In a ﬁnite container, there is an upper limit to the allowed wavelengths, because the boundary conditions
require the horizontal velocities to vanish at the vertical walls surrounding the ﬂuids. Any ﬂow in a ﬁnite
box-shaped container of horizontal length L must obey the boundary conditions vx = 0 for both x = 0
and x = L. Linear Euler ﬂow in a box can, like the ﬂows we are studying here, always be resolved into
a superposition of standing waves with horizontal velocity vx ∼ sin kx cos ωt. The boundary conditions
select the allowed wavenumbers to be k = nπ/L where n = 1, 2, . . . is an arbitrary integer. For n = 1 we
obtain the largest wavelength, λ = 2π/k = 2L, and this shows that as long as

λc = 1.7 cm and the critical velocity is Uc = 7.4 m s−1 . For a given velocity U , one can read off the range
of unstable wavelengths from this ﬁgure.
unstable wave modes with λ > λc cannot occur. If you invert a container with horizontal size smaller than
half the capillary wavelength, the heavier liquid will remain stably on top of the lighter.
Example 24.5.2 (Home experiment): Air against water has as we have seen before a capillary
wavelength of λc = 1.7 cm, so we require that L < 0.85 cm. Try it yourself with a glass tube of, for
example, 5 mm diameter. It works!

The Kelvin–Helmholtz instability
Layers of inviscid ﬂuids are capable of sliding past each other with a ﬁnite slip-velocity, if we disregard the
viscous boundary layers that otherwise will soften the sharp discontinuity in velocity. When waves arise
in the interface between the ﬂuids, they will so to speak ‘get in the way’ of the smooth ﬂow, leading us to
expect instability at a sufﬁciently high slip-velocity.
Suppose the upper layer is moving with velocity U in the rest frame of the lower layer. Taking into
account the slope ∇x h of the interface, the horizontal ﬂow in the upper layer will add U ∇x h to the vertical
velocity, such that the kinematic boundary conditions are replaced by,
v1z =

∂h

k A 1 = aω,

−k A 2 = a(ω − kU ),

ρ1 (g0 a − ω A 1 ) + αk 2 a = ρ2 (g0 a − (ω − kU )A 2 ).

wavelength λ = λc for which small disturbances will diverge exponentially with time. This is the Kelvin–
Helmholtz instability which permits us at least in principle to understand how the steadily streaming wind
is able to generate waves from tiny disturbances.
What actually happens to the unstable waves with their exponentially growing amplitudes, for example
how they grow into the larger waves created by a storm, cannot be predicted from linear theory. It is,
however, possible to say something about the statistics of wind-generated ocean waves without going into
too much nonlinear theory (see section 24.7).

∗ 24.6 Energy and attenuation
Surface waves contain both potential and kinetic energy, and this energy is attenuated by several effects.
First, there is viscous attenuation due to internal friction in the ﬂuid. Secondly, there is attenuation
from dissipative losses in the boundary layer that necessarily forms near the bottom, and thirdly there is
dissipation due to deviations of the value of surface tension from its equilibrium value, an effect that plays
a role when oil is poured on troubled waters. In this section we shall focus only on viscous attenuation.

We shall ﬁx the arbitrary constant by requiring the potential energy to vanish for the undisturbed surface
h = 0, so that

Î = 1 ρ0 g0 h 2 A.
2

(24.61)

The potential energy is always positive, and rises and falls in tune with the square of the wave height
h = a cos(kx − ωt). Note that this is an exact result, also valid when the amplitude is large. In the
linearized approximation where h = a cos(kx − ωt), we ﬁnd the average of the potential energy over a full

In the last step we have assumed that the amplitude is small, |h|
d, and replaced h by 0 in the upper
limit of the integral. It would in fact be wrong to keep the upper limit h because it contributes only to the
higher order terms. Inserting the explicit gravity wave solution (24.34), we obtain the time average of the
integrand,

Surprisingly, the average energy per unit of surface area,

expression is valid for a region of any size with ‘footprint’ area A.

Figure 24.8. The viscous amplitude attenuation length ξ for water plotted as a function of wavelength
λ. The viscosity is ν = 10−6 m2 s−1 and the surface tension α = 0.073 N m−1 . Viscous attenuation
essentially only plays a role for very small wavelengths.
The dissipative energy loss grows quadratically with the wavenumber and is most important for small
wavelengths, i.e. for capillary waves. These may as before be included by replacing g0 by the effective
gravity (24.42), but that does not change the above result.

40 µm, so that the condition should be satisﬁed under ordinary circumstances.

Energy and amplitude attenuation coefﬁcients
The energy propagates, as we have argued on page 339, with the group velocity cg rather than the phase
velocity c. Dividing the energy dissipation rate (24.69) by cg from (24.45), we obtain the spatial energy
attenuation coefﬁcient 2κ, deﬁned as the fractional loss of energy per unit of length,
2κ =

4νk 2
.
cg

(24.71)

As the energy is quadratic in the amplitude, the energy attenuation coefﬁcient is twice the spatial amplitude
attenuation coefﬁcient κ. The inverse amplitude attenuation coefﬁcient ξ = 1/κ is called the amplitude
attenuation length and indicates the distance over which the surface wave amplitude falls to about
e−1 ≈ 37% of its initial value. The amplitude attenuation length is plotted for water in ﬁgure 24.8 as
a function of wavelength.
Example 24.6.2: In water for λ = 1 m one ﬁnds ξ ≈ 8 km whereas for λ = λc = 1.7 cm one gets
ξ ≈ 86 cm. A raindrop hitting a lake surface thus creates a disturbance that dies out after propagating
through a metre or less whereas a big object, like the human body, will make waves with much longer
wavelength that continues essentially unattenuated right across the lake. In both these cases, however,
the amplitude of the ring-shaped surface waves will also diminish for purely geometric reasons.

24.7. STATISTICS OF WIND-GENERATED OCEAN WAVES

353

∗ 24.7 Statistics of wind-generated ocean waves
Waves may arise spontaneously from tiny perturbations at the wind/water interface when the wind speed
surpasses the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability threshold (page 349). The continued action of the wind and
nonlinear wave interactions raise the waves further, until a kind of dynamic equilibrium is reached in
which the surface may be viewed as a statistical ensemble of harmonic waves with a spectrum of periods,
wavelengths and amplitudes. Even if we do not understand the mechanism at play, it is nevertheless possible
to draw some quite general conclusions about the wave statistics and compare with observations.

Surface height observations
A ship or buoy bobbing at a ﬁxed position (x, y) of the ocean surface reﬂects the local surface height,
h(t) = h(x, y, t). The variations in surface height may be determined by many different techniques, for
example based on accelerometers, radar or sattelites. While the wind blows steadily, a long record of
N
1 measurements h n = h(tn ) can be collected at discrete times, tn = n (n = 1, 2, . . . , N), which for
simplicity are assumed to be evenly spaced.
The underlying wave structure of the surface creates strong correlations between successive
measurements of the local height. Short waves are carried on top of larger waves and so on. To get rid
of such correlations, we shall for odd N = 2M + 1 write the record as a superposition of simple harmonics
(see problem 24.8 for the precise theory of discrete Fourier transformations),
M

h n = a0 +

am cos(ωm tn − χm )

(24.72)

m=1

where ωm = 2πm/N is the circular frequency, am the amplitude, and χm the phase shift of the mth
harmonic. Given the N = 2M + 1 measured values h n these equations may be solved for the 2M + 1
unknowns, consisting of amplitudes and phase shifts plus the constant a0 . Note that the highest frequency
that can be resolved by N observations is ω M = 2π M/N ≈ π/ .
From the data record we may calculate various averages that can be related to the parameters of the
N
1
harmonic expansion. Thus, we ﬁnd the average height h = N n=1 h n = a0 because all the cosines
average out to zero. This shows that without any loss of generality we may always subtract the average
water level a0 from the measured heights. Assuming from now on that h = a0 = 0, the variance of the
height becomes
h2 =

In the last step we have used that the harmonics are uncorrelated so that the average of the product of
different harmonics vanishes, whereas the average of the square of any of the cosines is 1/2 (see problem
24.8).
For large N the frequencies constitute almost a continuum and since the energy is proportional to the
square of the amplitude, the power spectrum of the observed waves may be deﬁned to be

frequencies and a sharp drop-off below. The position of the peak depends strongly on the wind velocity U

Figure 24.9. Pierson–Moskowitz wave spectrum S as a function of circular frequency ω for three different
wind speeds U = 12, 15, 20 m s−1 . Note that the high-frequency tail is independent of U .
whereas the high-frequency tail appears to be the same for all U (see ﬁgure 24.9). We shall now see that it
is possible to understand the general form of the spectrum using the methods of statistical mechanics.
The wind speed U sets the level of excitation of the ocean surface at large, but cannot control what
happens locally so that the local wave energy E in a small neighbourhood of a ﬁxed point in principle
can take any value. But because the energy has to come from the huge reservoir of wave energy in
the surrounding ocean, the probability that the local energy actually has the value E is suppressed by a
canonical Boltzmann factor e−β E , where the ‘inverse temperature’ β is a measure of the level of excitation
of the ocean. Multiplying by the energy per unit of frequency d E/dω the energy spectrum becomes
S ∼ e−β E

(24.76)

Provided the nonlinearity is not excessive, the local energy is proportional to the square of the amplitude
E ∼ a 2 . Since the local energy cannot depend on U , the amplitude must be of magnitude a ∼ g0 /ω2 ,
2
because that is the only length scale which may be constructed from g0 and ω. Taking E ∼ g0 /ω4 and
normalizing the frequency in the exponent by g0 /U , we get the following model for the spectrum (after
redeﬁning β),

where α and β are dimensionless parameters. This spectrum has indeed a sharp low-frequency cut-off, a

The Pierson–Moskowitz empirical spectrum
Assuming that the statistical equilibrium is the same everywhere on the ocean surface, the dimensionless
parameters α and β can only depend on U and g0 , but since there is no dimensionless combination of U
and g0 , both α and β must be constants, independent of U . Pierson and Moskowitz2 ﬁtted empirical spectra

The actual spectrum is quite sensitive to the height at which the wind speed is determined because of air
turbulence close to the surface. In the data used in the ﬁt, the wind speed was measured about 20 m above
the average surface level.
In ﬁgure 24.9 the Pierson–Moskowitz spectrum is shown for three different wind speeds. One notes
how the high-frequency tails coincide, and how the low-frequency cut-off becomes sharper as the wind
speed increases.
Example 24.7.1: At a wind speed of U = 15 m s−1 the period at peak is about τ p = 11 s,
corresponding to a deep-water wavelength of λ p = 186 m and a phase velocity of c p = 17 m s−1 .
h 2 = 1.2 m. As a measure of the

p
determined from the deep-water dispersion relation (24.26). According to this estimate, the average
nonlinearity at play at this wind speed is indeed quite small.
The assumed dynamic equilibrium of the ocean surface takes a long time to develop, and more so the
higher the wind speed. A wind with velocity U lasting time t must have travelled over an upwind distance
L = U t, called the fetch. Even for a moderate wind at 15 m s−1 the sea takes about 8 h to develop, so the
fetch is about 500 km. Empirically the fetch grows roughly like U 3 , so that a strong wind at 30 m s−1 has
a fetch of 4000 km. Such winds rarely manage to fully develop the equilibrium power spectrum of the sea
because of the ﬁnite distance to the lee shore and the ﬁnite size of weather systems.

∗ 24.8 Global wave properties
Waves contain mass, momentum and energy, and the movement of ﬂuid also transports these quantities
around. To calculate the ﬂux of these quantities for gravity waves at ﬁnite depth we shall use the ﬂatbottom ﬁelds (24.34), remembering that they represent only the lowest order of approximation. Since we
do not know the nonlinear corrections to these ﬁelds, it is imperative to systematically keep only the leading
order in the amplitude a in all expressions.

The average momentum ﬂux is a measure of the average force of a wave hitting an obstacle, although
the true force is strongly complicated by the shape of the obstacle and by reﬂected waves [47].
Example 24.8.2: Wading near the shore in water to your waist, you are hit by harmonic waves of
amplitude a = 10 cm. If you are L = 50 cm wide, a deep-water wave with cg /c = 1/2 will act on you
with an average landwards force of (1/4)ρ0 g0 La 2 = 12 N. That will not topple you, but a wave with
ﬁve times higher amplitude could easily.

Waves are able to do work and many ingenious schemes have been thought up for the exploitation of wave
power. The power of a wave may be calculated from the rate of work performed by the pressure on a vertical

usually taken to conﬁrm that the energy in a harmonic wave also propagates with the group velocity.

carries an average power per unit of transverse length of P /L ≈ 106 W m−1 . Such a Tsunami can
really wreak havoc when it hits a coast.

Wading in the water near a beach and ﬁghting to stay upright in the surf, you are evidently under the
inﬂuence of nonlinear dynamics, simply because the breaking waves look so different to the smooth swells
in the open sea that gave rise to them. Equally nonlinear are the dynamics behind the hydraulic jumps
observed every day in the kitchen sink or on the beach, and the closely related dramatic river bores created
by the rising tide at the mouth of a river and rolling far upstream.
Nonlinear dynamics also lie behind the familiar sonic boom caused by a high-speed airplane passing
overhead, and the hopefully less familiar short-range shock wave created by an exploding grenade. At much
larger scales one encounters the huge atmospheric shock waves released by a thermonuclear explosion, or
the enormous shock waves from supernova explosions that may trigger star formation in the tenuous clouds
of interstellar matter in the galaxy, a phenomenon to which we may ultimately owe our own existence.
The beauty of ﬂuid mechanics lies in the knowledge that all these effects stem from the same nonlinear
aspects of the Navier–Stokes equations. In this chapter the global laws of balance derived in chapter 22 are
used to analyse the physics of ﬂuids in the extreme limit where the nonlinearity may create discontinuities,
or near discontinuities, in the properties of the ﬂuid. There are two major classes of such phenomena.
In an incompressible ﬂuid, a hydraulic jump is signalled by an abrupt rise in the height of the open ﬂuid
surface of a fast stream. When compressibility is taken into account, a sufﬁciently violent event may create
a shock wave in a ﬂuid, where the ﬂow speed abruptly drops from supersonic to subsonic. For ideal gases
the analysis is, as usual, particularly simple.

25.1 Hydraulic jumps
A stationary hydraulic jump or step is easily observed in a kitchen sink (see ﬁgure 25.2). The column of
water coming down from the tap splays out from the impact region in a roughly circular ﬂow pattern, and
at a certain radius the thin sheet of water abruptly thickens and stays thick beyond. The transition region
behind the front appears to have a narrow width and contain quite complicated ﬂow. Strongly turbulent
stationary hydraulic jumps may also arise in spillways, channelling surplus water from a dam into the river
downstream.

Stationary jump in planar horizontal ﬂow
We shall begin with an analysis of a stationary jump along a straight line orthogonal to the direction of a
uniform ﬂow over a horizontal planar surface. Although stationary jumps like the one in the kitchen sink
often have curved fronts, the abruptness of the jump allows us in the leading approximation to view it as
locally straight. The ﬂow is assumed to be steady before and after the jump, whereas in the transition region
there may be intermittency and turbulence. The Reynolds number is assumed to be so large that viscous
friction can be ignored outside the transition region.

Let the liquid ﬂow towards the jump with constant uniform velocity U and constant water level h.
Downstream from the jump the ﬂow has a different velocity U and a different water level h . The
dimensionless strength of the jump is deﬁned to be the relative change in height,

Energy balance will later show that the downstream water level must necessarily be the higher, such that
the strength is always positive, σ > 0. A jump is said to be weak when σ
1 and strong when σ
1.
All properties of the jump may, as we shall see, be expressed in terms of the inﬂow parameters U , h
and the strength σ . Let us choose a control volume with vertical sides and width L orthogonal to the ﬂow.
The upstream and downstream sides of the control volume are chosen orthogonal to the direction of ﬂow
and placed so far away from the transition region that both inﬂow and outﬂow are steady and uniform with
velocities U and U . Mass conservation then guarantees that the total volume ﬂux at the outlet is the same
as at the inlet,
Q = LhU = Lh U .

(25.3)

From this we get the ratio of velocities

Evidently, since σ > 0, the downstream velocity is always the smaller one.
Momentum balance (22.15) similarly guarantees that the net outﬂow of momentum from the control
volume equals the total external force acting on the control volume in the direction of the ﬂow. For an
inviscid ﬂuid the horizontal force is entirely due to the pressure acting on the two vertical sides of the
control volume where the liquid enters or leaves. The pressure in the uniform planar ﬂow that reigns in
these regions is hydrostatic, given by p = p0 + ρ0 g0 (h − z) at the inlet and p = p0 + ρ0 g0 (h − z)
at the outlet, where p0 is the constant (atmospheric) pressure on the open liquid surface. Carrying out the
integrals over the inlet and outlet as in example 4.1.2 on page 47, momentum balance becomes,
ρ0 QU − ρ0 QU = 1 ρ0 g0 Lh 2 − 1 ρ0 g0 Lh 2 .

On the left-hand side one ﬁnds the difference between the momentum ﬂuxes through the outlet and inlet of
the control volume, and on the right the difference between the total pressure forces acting on the inlet and
the outlet. Eliminating U and h using (25.1) and (25.3) the resulting equation may be solved for the entry
velocity, to get
U=

In both of these expressions the velocity scale is set by c = g0 h , which we recognize as the smallamplitude shallow-water wave speed (24.37) in the inﬂow region. Similarly, the shallow-water wave speed

in the outﬂow region is c = g0 h = c 1 + σ . Since σ > 0, it follows immediately that the various
velocities obey the inequalities U > c > c > U . Note that the smallest outﬂow velocity is obtained in the

which is also plotted in ﬁgure 25.1(a). Since σ > 0, we have Fr > 1 > Fr , and the ﬂow is said to be
supercritical before the jump, and subcritical after.

Stationary circular jump
The nearly circular stationary hydraulic jump in the kitchen sink may be viewed as being locally straight.
The position of the jump is difﬁcult to predict because it depends on the shape of the particular kitchen sink
(see page 363). Here we shall simply place the jump at a certain radius r = R from the centre and calculate
the shape of the ﬂow before and after.
In accordance with what we did for the planar jump, we shall also here assume that the steady, radial,
inviscid ﬂow over the kitchen sink bottom is independent of z , i.e. of the form vr = u(r ). Apart from the
jump region, the dynamics are governed by the constancy of the mass ﬂux Q and of the Bernoulli function
H for a streamline running along the surface,
Q = 2π r h(r )u(r ),

(25.10a)

H = 1 u(r )2 + g0 h(r ).
2

(25.10b)

In the general case this becomes a third degree equation for u (or h ) with a rather messy solution.
In a typical kitchen sink experiment, as for example the one described below, the jump is usually quite
strong with σ
1. This implies that the local Froude number Fr(r ) = u(r )/ g0 h(r ) will be large in front
of the jump and from the constancy of H it follows that u(r ) will be nearly constant. Behind the jump the
local Froude number will instead be small, which again due to the constancy of H implies that the height
h(r ) will be nearly constant. Thus, we have approximately,
u(r ) = U,
u(r ) =

Q
,
2πr h

h(r ) =

Q
,
2πrU

h(r ) = h ,

for r < R.
(25.11)
for r > R.

Because of mass conservation across the jump, U h = U h , the Reynolds number Re = U h/ν = Q/2πr ν
is continuous and decreases everywhere inversely with the radius. To test whether the assumption of inviscid
ﬂow is justiﬁed, one may compare the water level h(r ) with a thickness estimate of the boundary layer, for
√
example δ(r ) = 3 νr/u(r ) (see chapter 28).
In a kitchen sink experiment it is fairly easy to determine the volume discharge rate Q by collecting
water in a standard household measure for a little while. From the radius a of the water jet just before it
splays out at the bottom one may determine the average velocity U = Q/πa 2 which by Bernoulli’s theorem

should be nearly the same as the radial velocity along the bottom of the sink. From Q , U and R all the jump
parameters may then be calculated.
Example 25.1.1 (A kitchen sink experiment): In a casual home-made kitchen sink experiment (see
ﬁgure 25.2 and 25.3) the discharge rate was observed to be Q = 100 cm3 s−1 , the radius of the
water jet a = 0.5 cm, and the radius of the jump R = 7 cm. The velocity before the jump is
U = Q/πa 2 = 127 cm s−1 , and using (25.11) we calculate the height just before the jump to be
merely h √ h(R) = Q/2π RU = 0.018 cm. The corresponding Froude number is fairly large,
=
Fr = U/ g0 h = 30, and using (25.8) we determine the jump strength to be σ = 42. The height
after the jump h = (1 + σ )h = 0.76 cm which appears to be a bit larger than the observed height.
The velocity after the jump is U = U/(1 + σ ) = 3 cm s−1 , corresponding to a Froude number of
Fr = 0.11. The Reynolds number at the jump is moderate, Re = U h/ν = 264, but the estimated
boundary layer thickness at the jump, δ(R) = 0.065 cm, is almost four times the water level before
the jump. Viscosity must for this reason play an important role for this experiment, in particular in the
region just before the jump, casting some doubt on the validity of the theory in this case.

Energy loss in the stationary jump
It would be tempting to make use of Bernoulli’s theorem along a streamline going across the stationary
hydraulic jump, but that is impossible because of the unruly ﬂuid in the transition region which messes up
streamlines and generates a dissipative (viscous) loss of mechanical energy.
We may nevertheless use mechanical energy balance (22.53) to calculate the rate of loss of energy from
the system by keeping track of what mechanical energy goes into the control volume and what comes out.
Mechanical energy balance takes the form,

Note that the height is enlarged by a factor 4 relative to the radius. The solid line is the water level given by
the model (25.11) whereas the dashed line is the estimated thickness of the boundary layer. The thickness
of the jump is taken from the estimate on page 364.
On the left-hand side we have the difference between the rates of outﬂow and inﬂow of mechanical energy
from the control volume, calculated from the speciﬁc mechanical energy density, 1/2v 2 + g0 z , integrated
over the outlet and inlet. On the right there is ﬁrst the difference in rates of work of the pressure forces
integrated over the inlet and outlet, and ﬁnally P , the rate of loss of energy due to the work of internal
friction given by (17.18).

where H and H are the values of the Bernoulli function (16.15) at the surface of the water before and

Since the rate of viscous energy loss necessarily must be positive (page 236), we conclude as promised that
a stationary hydraulic jump will always have positive strength, σ > 0. Relative to the rate of kinetic energy

(25.15)

It converges as expected to unity for σ → ∞. For σ = 1, corresponding to Fr = 1.73, only 8.3% of the
kinetic energy is lost, whereas for σ = 10 corresponding to Fr = 8.1, the fractional loss is 69%. Strong
hydraulic jumps are efﬁcient dissipators of kinetic energy, and this is in fact their function in dam spillways
where high speed surplus water must be slowed down before it is released into the river downstream of the
dam.

Moving hydraulic jumps
Moving hydraulic jumps are seen on the beach when waves roll in, sometimes in several layers on top of
each other. More dramatic river bores may be formed by the rising tide near the mouth of a river. When the
circumstances are right such waves can roll far up the river with a nearly vertical foaming turbulent front.
In the laboratory an ideal river bore can be created in a long canal with water initially at rest. When the wall
in one end of the canal is set into motion with constant velocity, a bore will form and move down the canal
with constant speed and constant water level.
The only difference between a river bore and a stationary hydraulic jump lies in the frame of reference.
The ideal river bore is obtained in the frame where the ﬂuid in front of the jump is at rest. Subtracting

U −U

A reﬂection bore in a closed
canal is obtained by subtracting
U from all velocities of the
stationary jump.

U from all velocities (and reversing their directions), the front itself will move with velocity U , and the
ﬂuid behind the jump will move in the same direction with velocity U − U , which is smaller than the
shallow-water velocity c = g0 h behind the jump for σ < 2.21.
There is also the possibility of choosing a reference frame in which the ﬂuid behind the jump is at rest.
Subtracting U from the velocities of the stationary jump, this describes a stationary ﬂow being reﬂected in
a closed canal. Such a reﬂection bore moves with velocity U out of the canal while the ﬂow into the canal
has velocity U − U .
The reﬂection bore has in fact some bearing on the stationary jump in the kitchen sink. The
layer of ﬂuid spreads initially over the bottom of the sink with a high Froude number, and thus
a roughly constant velocity and decreasing thickness. The spreading layer of ﬂuid encounters
resistance against the free ﬂow from the sides of the sink, or from the slight slope and curvature
of its bottom1 . This creates a reﬂection bore with small Froude number, which moves inwards with
roughly constant height and increasing velocity, until it stops when it encounters an outﬂow with
velocity and thickness that ﬁts a stationary jump. One may also observe that when the faucet is
closed the stationary jump in the kitchen sink immediately turns into a river bore moving towards
the centre.

Thickness of a hydraulic jump
A river bore is ‘pumped up’ by
small-amplitude surface waves
of sufﬁciently long wavelength.
Short waves move too slowly to
catch up with the jump.

A river bore is created by the rising tide at the river mouth, and as long as the tide keeps rising, it will
continue to pour more water in. The additional water supplied by the rising tide in a small time interval
may be thought of as a small-amplitude surface wave riding upriver on top of the already existing bore.
Although this mechanism is most obvious for the river bore, both the reﬂection bore and the stationary
hydraulic jump must also be built up ‘from behind’ by small-amplitude waves.
Any small-amplitude surface wave may be resolved into a superposition of harmonic waves with a
spectrum of wavelengths. Consider now a harmonic wave with wavelength λ on its way upstream towards a
stationary hydraulic jump. In the rest frame of the outﬂow, the energy in a harmonic wave with wavenumber

where ψ = kh = 2πh /λ0 . This transcendental equation may be solved for ψ and the result is shown in
ﬁgure 25.5(a) as a function of the jump strength σ . In ﬁgure 25.5(b) this is converted to a plot of the ratio
λ0 / h of the minimal wavelength to the upstream height h as a function of the Froude number Fr.
The hydraulic jump effectively acts as a high-pass ﬁlter on backﬂow wavelengths, only letting waves
with sufﬁciently large wavelength, λ > λ0 , through to ‘feed’ it. The smooth part of a hydraulic jump cannot
contain details much smaller than the waves that maintain it, so the minimal wavelength λ0 may be used as
a measure of the minimal thickness of the transition region.
Example 25.1.2: A river bore with front height h − h = 1 m moves up a river of depth h = 0.5 m.
The jump strength is σ = (h − h)/ h = 2, corresponding to Fr = 2.45, and the front velocity
becomes U = 5.4 m s−1 while the velocity of the ﬂow behind the front is U − U = 3.6 m s−1 .
From ﬁgure 25.5(b) we ﬁnd λ0 / h = 11.6, so that the minimal wavelength and thus the thickness
becomes λ0 = 6.7 m.

25.2 Shocks in ideal gases
An explosion in a ﬂuid at rest creates an expanding ﬁreball of hot gases and debris which pushes the ﬂuid
in front of it. If the velocity imparted to the ﬂuid by the explosion is smaller than the velocity of sound in
the ﬂuid, an ordinary sound wave will run ahead of the debris and with a loud bang inform you that the
explosion took place. If the initial expansion velocity of the ﬁreball is larger than the sound velocity in the
ﬂuid, the ﬁrst sign of the explosion will be the arrival of a supersonic front (here we disregard the ﬂash
of light which will arrive much earlier). The sudden jump in the properties of a ﬂuid at the passage of a
supersonic front is called a shock. Stationary shocks may also arise downstream from a constriction in a duct

Pierre Henri Hugoniot (1851–
1887). French engineer; worked
mainly in the marine artillery service. Wrote only one (long) article, published in the year of his
untimely death, on ‘the propagation of movement in bodies, particularly in perfect gases’ [33].

We shall begin by analysing stationary planar shocks, which like plane sound waves are normal to the
direction of the ﬂow. We shall later see that shocks are in fact not much thicker than the molecular length
scale, allowing us to view all shocks as truly singular and locally plane. In the rest system of the shock we
choose a narrow control volume just containing an area A of the shock front. Upstream from the shock the
gas has velocity U , temperature T , pressure p and density ρ; downstream it has velocity U , temperature
T , pressure p and density ρ .
There is a strong analogy between a hydraulic jump and a shock, although the strength of the shock is
deﬁned as the relative pressure increase,

(25.18)

We shall see below that the Second Law of Thermodynamics requires that σ > 0. A shock is said to be
weak when σ
1 and strong when σ
1.
Since the shock is so narrow there will be essentially no room for dissipation of energy, allowing us to
apply Bernoulli’s theorem. Using the pressure function (16.37) for an ideal gas with adiabatic index γ , we
obtain three basic equations, called the Rankine–Hugoniot relations,
ρU = ρ U ,

These relations are simple rearrangements of mass, momentum and energy balance across the shock. They
may be solved explicitly for the downstream parameters in terms of the upstream ones (see problem 25.3),
but it is much more convenient to express the solution in terms of the strength of the shock.
Using (25.19a) to eliminate U in (25.19b), we obtain,
U2 =

where the second equation is obtained from the ﬁrst by swapping primed and unprimed variables. Inserting
this into (25.19c) we ﬁnd the ratio of densities,

The temperature ratio may now be obtained from the ideal gas law, T /T = ( p /ρ )/( p/ρ) =
( p / p)(ρ/ρ ).
Since we are interested in supersonic ﬂow, it is most convenient to express the velocities in terms of the
√
dimensionless Mach numbers, Ma = U/c and Ma = U /c , where c = γ p/ρ and c = γ p /ρ are the
sound velocities before and after the shock. Using (25.20) we ﬁnd,

given in (25.24).
Up to this point, the strength may in principle range over both negative and positive values in the interval
−1 < σ < ∞. The physical asymmetry between positive and negative strength becomes apparent when
we calculate the change in speciﬁc entropy s = s − s across the shock. Using (C.21c) we ﬁnd,

where cV is the speciﬁc heat constant of the gas (C.18). The right-hand side is a monotonically increasing
function of σ which vanishes for σ = 0 and is thus negative for −1 < σ < 0 (see problem 25.5 and
ﬁgure 25.6). However, by the Second Law of thermodynamics the speciﬁc entropy change is not permitted
to be negative, and consequently we require that σ ≥ 0. We have thus reached the promised conclusion
that in a stationary shock the velocity must go from supersonic (Ma > 1) to subsonic (Ma < 1) in the
downstream direction. The various dimensionless quantities are plotted in ﬁgure 25.6 as functions of the
inﬂow Mach number Ma.

Oblique shock
An oblique planar shock front may be obtained in a reference frame moving tangentially to the stationary
normal shock with constant velocity V . In the moving frame the ﬂow velocities are denoted U and U with
angle of incidence φ and transmission angle φ . Using that the tangential velocity is the same on both sides
of the shock, V = U cot φ = U cot φ , we obtain a relation between incidence and strength,

(25.25)

Since σ > 0, the right-hand side is always smaller than unity, implying that the transmission angle is always
smaller than the angle of incidence φ < φ.
The geometry shows that the angle of incidence is given by sin φ = U/U , and since U → c for σ → 0,
the incidence angle for a weak oblique shock obeys sin φ0 = c/U = 1/Ma, where Ma = U /c is the Mach
number of the inﬂow. The angle φ0 is called the Mach angle,

The Mach construction of the
shock cone for a supersonic
object. In a time t, the object
moves forward a distance U t
while the sound emitted at t = 0
forms a sphere of radius ct. The
opening angle of the envelope of
all spheres is sin φ0 = ct/U t =
c/U = 1/Ma.

Example 25.2.1: For an aircraft at Ma = 2, the Mach angle is φ0 = 30 ◦ , so when you hear
the sonic boom of the aircraft passing overhead at h = 20 km altitude, it is already a distance
d = h cot φ0 ≈ 35 km beyond your position.

Moving normal shock
A stationary planar normal shock may be converted to a normal shock moving through a gas at rest by
choosing a reference frame moving with velocity U . In this frame, the previously incoming gas will now be
at rest, whereas the shock front itself moves in the opposite direction with velocity U , and the gas behind
the front moves in the same direction with velocity U − U which may or may not be supersonic. Locally,
this describes a blast wave arising from a violent explosion, to be discussed in the following section.

Front thickness
Since the gas is completely at rest before the passage of the moving front, it is clear that a moving shock
must be ‘fed from behind’, like a hydraulic jump, but because air is non-dispersive all small-amplitude
waves move upstream at the same speed, c = γ p /ρ . Consequently there will be no lower limit to the
wavelength of disturbances running upstream towards the front, and from a macroscopic point of view the
shock front has vanishing thickness, as long as viscosity can be disregarded.
The only quantity with the dimension of length that may naturally be constructed from the front velocity
U and the kinematic viscosity ν is,
δ∼

(25.27)

For a weak shock in the atmosphere under normal conditions we have ν ≈ 1.6 × 10−5 m2 s−1 and
U ≈ c ≈ 340 m s−1 , leading to δ ∼ 45 nm, so that the viscous thickness of the front is comparable
to the mean free path in the gas. This conclusion actually invalidates the calculation, but for all practical
purposes a shock front may be assumed to have zero thickness.

25.3 Atmospheric blast wave
A large explosion in the atmosphere generates a blast wave bounded by a spherical supersonic shock front.
Such blast waves are mostly invisible, but ﬁlms of nuclear or thermonuclear bomb explosions show that the
physical conditions can become so extreme that the blast wave can be seen as a rapidly expanding spherical
ﬁreball, appearing right after the initial ﬂash but before the mushroom cloud erupts. In this section we shall
investigate the time evolution of such blast waves in the atmosphere, following the road laid out by G. I.
Taylor in the 1940s2 .

Radius of the strong shock front
Let the atmosphere initially be at rest with density ρ0 and pressure p0 . The blast deposits almost instantly
a huge amount of energy E 0 within a tiny region of radius a, which initially contains the possibly ionized
gases produced in the blast, as well as the solid remains of the bomb if there are any. The huge pressure in
the initial ﬁreball creates a shock front expanding at supersonic speed. After some time t, the shock front
has become nearly spherical with a radius R(t) that is very large compared to the initial size a. The volume
inside the front contains essentially all of the initial energy E 0 in the form of ‘shocked’ air with only little
contamination from the bomb itself. At this stage the shock has become a purely atmospheric phenomenon
and all details about its origin in any particular explosion have been ‘forgotten’.
Under these conditions the radius of the shock front R(t) will be determined by the equations of gas
dynamics, and can only depend on time t, the total energy E 0 , and the atmospheric parameters ρ0 and p0 .
In a strong shock the ambient pressure p0 is negligible compared to the pressures inside, implying that R(t)
should be ﬁnite in the limit of p0 → 0, and thus only depend on t, E 0 and ρ0 . Since E 0 /ρ0 is measured in
units of of J kg−1 m−3 = m5 s−2 , the only possible form of the relationship between size and time is

R(t) = A

E0t 2
ρ0

,

(25.29)

where A is a numerical constant which as we shall see below is very close to unity.
It is remarkable that a phenomenon as violent as an atomic explosion can be captured in such a simple
relationship. Taylor used it in 1947 to estimate the yield of the ﬁrst nuclear bomb to be about 1014 J from
a time-lapse sequence of recently released photographs, a feat which created some embarrassment with the
security authorities and earned him a mild admonishment, although he had done nothing wrong [8].

published it in 1950. Photographs of the ﬁrst atomic test were declassiﬁed by the US Atomic Energy Commission in
1947, although its yield remained classiﬁed.

ﬂow velocity just behind the front. The temperature is obtained from the ideal gas law,

where Rmol is the molar gas constant and Mmol is the molar weight of the gas. Note that none of these
quantities depend on the ambient pressure p0 . In the following we shall use the value γ = 7/5 for diatomic
gas, although the violent initial shock may dissociate a fraction of the molecules.
T1 =

Example 25.3.1 (Trinity): The ﬁrst atomic bomb test, codenamed Trinity, was carried out at
Alamogordo, New Mexico on July 16, 1945. Its yield was E 0 ≈ 8.5 × 1013 J which is roughly
equivalent to 17 000 tons of the high explosive TNT. Taking A = 1 and γ = 7/5 we ﬁnd that after
t = 15 ms the ﬁreball has expanded to a radius R ≈ 110 m with the front moving at a speed of
U ≈ 2900 m s−1 . The pressure just inside the front is p1 ≈ 85 atm, the density ρ1 ≈ 7.2 kg m−3 , and
the temperature T1 ≈ 4200 K.

Isentropic radial gas dynamics
A spherically invariant isentropic ﬂow in an ideal gas is described by a purely radial velocity ﬁeld v =
v(r, t)er , a density ﬁeld ρ(r, t), a pressure ﬁeld p(r, t) and the ﬁeld of speciﬁc entropy s = cV log( pρ −γ ).

(25.32c)

The ﬁrst is the Euler equation, the second the continuity equation on radial form, and the last expresses
that the ﬂow is isentropic, meaning that the speciﬁc entropy is constant along a comoving (particle) orbit.
The last equation also shows that if the initial state is homentropic with spatially constant speciﬁc entropy
∂s/∂r = 0, it will remain so forever. In a strong blast entropy is only produced right at the front, and that
does not lead to a homentropic state of the air behind the front.

Strong self-similar shock
In the strong shock limit, σ → ∞ and p0 → 0, the only parameter with dimension of length is the radius of
the shock front R(t), which we for a moment pretend not to know explicitly. The proper non-dimensional
radial variable for all the ﬁelds is therefore,
ξ=

r
.
R(t)

(25.33)

Including suitable dimensional coefﬁcients depending only on R(t) and ρ0 , the ﬁelds are assumed to be of
the form,
˙
v = R(t)u(ξ ),

(25.34a)

ρ = ρ0 f (ξ ),
˙
p = ρ0 R(t)2 q(ξ ),

(25.34b)
(25.34c)

where a dot indicates differentiation after time. With this assumption, the spatial variation of the ﬁelds is
self-similar at all times.
Inserting these ﬁelds into the equations of motion (25.32) we obtain three coupled ordinary ﬁrst-order
differential equations, and using a prime to denote differentiation after ξ , we ﬁnd

(25.36)

The α-terms on the left-hand side of (25.35) stem from the explicitly time-dependent prefactors of the ﬁelds.
Since α only depends on t and the other functions only on ξ , it follows from these equations that α must be
a constant, independent of time. The solution to (25.36) is then a power law
R(t) ∼ t 1/(1−α).

(25.37)

The value of α cannot be determined from the dynamic equations alone but depends on the boundary
conditions imposed on the solution, in particular the condition that the radial velocity u must vanish at
ξ = 0. We shall determine it below by requiring that the excess energy E 0 is constant.

Although it is possible to ﬁnd an analytic solution [62], it turns out to be quite complicated, and it is much
easier to integrate the differential equations numerically. The numeric solution is plotted in ﬁgure 25.9(a)
for γ = 7/5 with the functions normalized by their values at ξ = 1. Evidently there are two distinct regions
in a strong shock, a core for ξ < 0.7 where the pressure is nearly constant with q0 /q1 ≈ 0.37 and the
velocity increases linearly, and a shell for ξ > 0.7 where the velocity and pressure rise rapidly to meet the
required values at the front.

Excess energy
The total energy of the gas in the volume inside the shock front consists of the kinetic energy of the moving
gas plus its internal energy. Subtracting the internal energy of the gas before the explosion we ﬁnd from
(22.60) on page 320 the excess of energy inside the shock front,

Barring radiative losses, this energy must be constant and equal to the extra energy added to the atmosphere
in the point-like explosion. It takes quite a bit of algebraic work to demonstrate explicitly from the dynamics
(25.32) and the strong shock properties (25.30) that the time derivative of this expression indeed vanishes.
Inserting the self-similar ﬁelds (25.34), the excess energy (25.39) becomes in the limit of p0 → 0,

It is immediately clear from (25.40) that E 0 ∼ R 3 R 2 ∼ t (3+2α)/(1−α), so for the power law (25.37) to lead
to a constant energy, the exponent must be α = −3/2, and thus R ∼ t 2/5 . This conﬁrms the dimensional

analysis (25.29), and inserting R = (2/5)R/t in (25.40) we also obtain an expression for the dimensionless

PROBLEMS

373

The weakening shock
As the shock front expands, it decreases in strength until it no longer satisﬁes the conditions for the
strong shock approximation used above. The characteristic strength for the breakdown of the strong shock
approximation may be chosen to be σs = 2γ /(γ − 1) where the two terms in the denominator of the density
ratio (25.22) become equal. For γ = 7/5 we have σs = 7 and thus p1 = (1 + σs ) p0 = 8 atm. Using the
strong shock formalism in the Trinity example 25.3.1 this is estimated to happen at time t ≈ 110 ms when
the front radius is R ≈ 240 m and its velocity U ≈ 900 m s−1 .
Continuing the expansion beyond this point, the core pressure will decrease until it reaches the ambient
pressure p0 . At this point the core can no longer perform work on the surrounding atmosphere and will
stop expanding. The core is very hot due to its large entropy with a correspondingly low density, and the
buoyancy of the low-density core will make it rise like a thermal bubble, creating thereby the stalk of the
mushroom cloud. We may estimate the time when the core expansion ceases by equating the core pressure
p = ρ0 U 2 q0 with atmospheric pressure p0 . This is probably a rather bad approximation, but in lieu of a
better one we ﬁnd in the Trinity example 25.3.1 that it happens at time t ≈ 260 ms when the front radius is
R ≈ 340 m and its velocity has dropped to U ≈ 525 m s−1 .
After this point the shock continues as a spherical wave in the form of a thin shell. When such a front
passes a given point, the pressure ﬁrst rises above atmospheric pressure, followed by a characteristic suction
phase where the pressure drops below atmospheric pressure.

Whirls and vortices are common features of real ﬂuids. Stirring the coffee, you create a circulating motion,
a whirl that dies out after some time when you stop stirring. A fast spinning vortex may form at the drain
of a bathtub when it is emptied, and can remain quasi-stable as long as there is enough water in the tub.
Normally, whirls and vortices are invisible far away from free boundaries, but in the bathtub the drain vortex
is made visible by soap remains clouding the water and the depression it creates at the surface. It may even
become audible, because water falling through the drain sucks air down from the surface.
In the atmosphere above heated ground, whirls and vortices arise all the time. Mostly they are small and
invisible, but sometimes they pick up dust and debris and appear as dust devils. Larger dust devils, in some
countries called sky-pumps, are known to pick up haystacks and scatter them, or to throw tables around in
sidewalk cafes. When the heat-driven air vortices grow really big and nasty, they become tornadoes. The
force powering heat-driven vortices is fundamentally the same as the force that maintains a bathtub vortex,
namely gravity. Whereas a bathtub vortex is driven by gravity acting on the water going down the drain, a
tornado is maintained by the buoyancy of hot air draining skywards.
Vortices are also found in the wakes of moving objects. From the tips of the wings of aircraft there
will always trail long invisible vortices (to be discussed in chapter 29). Large passenger aircraft taking off
or landing create strong and fairly stable vortices, capable of overturning smaller planes following after.
‘Beware of vortex’ is a common warning issued by ﬂight controllers to small aircraft when taking off or
landing behind heavy passenger planes.
The chapter sets the stage with a discussion of the structure of free cylindrical vortices in an
incompressible ﬂuid, and continues with a presentation of the basic vortex dynamics in non-viscous ﬂuids.
The remainder of the chapter is devoted to models for non-singular laminar vortices driven by secondary
ﬂow. Extensive treatment of vortex structure and dynamics may be found in [60, 45].

26.1 Free cylindrical vortices
The spindle-driven vortex discussed on page 262 was powered by a rotating cylindrical spindle, which
delivered the work necessary to overcome viscous friction in the ﬂuid. Although the ﬂow pattern (18.74)
did not depend explicitly on the viscosity of the ﬂuid, a ﬁnite viscosity was nevertheless necessary for the
spindle to be able to ‘crank up’ the vortex, starting from ﬂuid at rest.
In a truly inviscid ﬂuid, we would not be able to crank up the vortex, but once it had somehow been
established there would be no viscous losses and the vortex would keep spinning forever. The solid spindle
could then with impunity be replaced by a core made from the same ﬂuid as the vortex and, for example,
rotating as a solid body with the same angular velocity as the spindle.

The cusp in the Rankine vortex at the core boundary creates a ﬁnite jump in stress at r = c, which is
physically unacceptable because it violates Newton’s third law. The Rankine vortex is only meaningful in
the limit of a truly inviscid ﬂuid.

Interpolating vortex
Horace Lamb (1849–1934).
British physicist. Contributed
mainly to acoustics and ﬂuid mechanics. His textbooks remained
for many years the standard in
these ﬁelds.

It is possible to ﬁnd a smooth interpolating function which coincides with the Rankine vortex for r
and r
c, for example the Lamb vortex,
vφ =

which approaches the Rankine vortex for both r

everywhere and the problem with Newton’s third law has disappeared. The velocity ﬁeld is shown in

r = 0) becomes smaller. (a) Azimuthal velocity. (b) Pressure.
The pressure is, of course, lower at the centre than at inﬁnity (see ﬁgure 26.1(b)), and for a liquid vortex in
constant gravity this would create a central depression in the open surface of the same shape (see section
26.6).
The resolution of the stress problem comes at a price, because the interpolating vortex cannot be stable
on its own in a viscous ﬂuid. The shear stress will cause dissipation of kinetic energy everywhere in the
ﬂuid and make the vortex spin down. The largest shear stress is found just outside the core and will slow
down the core’s rotation while expanding its radius to conserve angular momentum. We shall now see that
the Lamb vortex with a time-dependent core radius is an exact solution to the Navier–Stokes equations.

Diffusive spin-down of vortex
Assuming that the azimuthal velocity ﬁeld retains its purely cylindrical form vφ (r, t) at all times, we may
go through the same steps as lead to (18.60) and derive the time-dependent Navier–Stokes equation in
cylindrical coordinates,
∂vφ

(17.5), and given any initial ﬁeld vφ (r, 0) it will always produce a solution.
By insertion one may directly verify that the solution which for t = 0 starts out as the interpolating
vortex (26.5) is,

where C is a constant. It is called the Oseen–Lamb vortex and its time evolution is plotted in ﬁgure 26.2.
Whereas the asymptotic circulation is constant, the core radius, c(t) = c2 + 4νt, grows with time, while
the angular velocity of the core, (t) = ∂vφ /∂r |r=0 = C/(c2 + 4νt), decreases. The time it takes for the
vortex to double its original core radius is t = 3c2 /4ν, and the core overtakes any point r , well outside the
original core, in a time t r 2 /4ν. These times are recognized as typical momentum diffusion time scales
(see page 233), but in this case the quantity that diffuses is actually angular momentum.
Finally, it should be mentioned that there are many other exact solutions to (26.9), some of which are
found in problems 26.9 and 26.10.

²

Example 26.1.1 (Bathtub vortex): A water vortex with core radius c = 3 cm doubles the radius of
its viscous core in the time 3c2 /4ν = 675 s, a little more than 11 min. This is surprisingly large, but it
should be remembered that the estimate is only valid for laminar ﬂow. Turbulence make most real-life
bathtub vortices spin down faster, unless they are fed by inﬂow.

26.2 Ideal vortex dynamics
Vortex lines were deﬁned (on page 219) to be curves that always follow the instantaneous vorticity ﬁeld,
ω = ∇ × v. Like streamlines, vortex lines cannot cross each other, and since the vorticity ﬁeld is a ‘curl’,
it is rigorously divergence-free, ∇ · ω = 0. This implies that vortex lines cannot emerge from anywhere,
but must form closed curves, or curves coming from and going to the boundaries of the ﬂow (which may be
spatial inﬁnity). Vortex dynamics can be quite complicated, and we shall here only present a few general
results mainly due to Helmholtz.

Copyright © 2005 IOP Publishing Ltd.

26.2. IDEAL VORTEX DYNAMICS

379

Vortex tubes
The set of vortex lines that pass through the points of a closed curve at a given time form together a
vortex tube which may curve and bend in space. We shall now prove that whatever shape it takes, it will
nevertheless have the same total ﬂux of vorticity through every cross section. To prove this we just use
Gauss’ theorem on the closed surface formed by a stretch of vortex tube between two cross sections, S1 and
S2 . Since the divergence of the vorticity ﬁeld vanishes, the closed surface integral over this stretch of tube
must vanish,

S

ω · dS =

S2

ω · dS −

S1

ω · d S = 0.

(26.11)

The sides of the tube do not contribute to the integral, because the normals to the surface elements are
orthogonal to the vortex lines, i.e. to the vorticity ﬁeld.
The common ﬂux through any cross section of a vortex tube is called the strength of the tube, and by
Stokes theorem (16.57) this ﬂux equals the circulation around any curve circumnavigating the tube along
its surface. From Kelvin’s circulation theorem (16.59) we know that in an ideal ﬂuid the circulation around
a comoving curve is constant in time. A comoving vortex tube thus retains its strength in the course of time,
allowing us to view a vortex tube (and even a single vortex line) as an individual material ‘object’ that is
advected, ‘blown along’, with the ambient ﬂow.

The vortex core
Vortices often have a central vortex tube, called the core of the vortex, containing almost all of the vorticity,
with the ﬂow being nearly irrotational outside, like in the Rankine vortex (26.1). From Stokes’ theorem it
then follows that the circulation is the same along any closed curve that circumnavigates the core. Since the
core region is a vortex tube, it cannot disappear but only move around, and a vortex in an ideal ﬂuid thus
acquires an identity of its own. It may connect to the boundaries (possibly at inﬁnity), but often it will take
the form of a closed loop, which like a smoke ring drifts in the wind created by itself.
In the extreme and singular limit, where the vortex core becomes inﬁnitely thin and its vorticity ﬁeld
inﬁnitely high while the strength remains ﬁnite, it is called a vortex ﬁlament. A vortex ﬁlament is entirely
characterized by its strength and the curve that describes the whereabouts of the core. In the preceding
section we saw that viscosity will make the core of a free vortex expand and eventually cause the whole
vortex to disappear, but if the core radius is small compared to the radius of curvature of the ﬁlament and
other length scales in the ﬂow, a real vortex may in fact behave as a vortex ﬁlament over long periods of
time.
The indestructibility of vortex ﬁlaments in ideal ﬂow inspired Lord Kelvin in 1867 to suggest that
atoms could be microscopic ring vortices in the ideal ether, and that vortex theory could be the
foundation for what today would be called a ‘theory of everything’. This early ‘string theory’ of
matter was quickly abandoned but inspired instead the development of mathematical knot theory.

The line vortex
The simplest vortex ﬁlament is a line vortex in which the core is a straight line. In either cylindrical or
Cartesian coordinates the velocity ﬁeld becomes,
v=

C
(−y, x, 0)
.
eφ = C 2
r
x + y2

(26.12)

Comparing with the Rankine vortex (26.1) we see that the constant C is obtained in the limit where → ∞
and c → 0 such that c2 remains ﬁnite. Integrating around the vortex along a streamline of radius r , we
ﬁnd the circulation = 2πr vφ = 2πC. The circulation is thus independent of r as expected from Stokes’
theorem and the irrotational character of the ﬂow.
Outside the singular core the velocity ﬁeld of a line vortex has vanishing vorticity and must therefore
be a gradient ﬁeld, v = ∇ , where
is the velocity potential. From the gradient operator expressed

Two parallel line vortices of
equal strength force each other
to move with their cores on a
common circle. Up to six vortex
ﬁlaments may participate in the
dance.

(26.13)

The azimuthal angle φ is a multivalued function which increases by 2π each time a curve circles around
the vortex core, reﬂecting of course the non-vanishing value of the circulation = 2π C arising from the
inﬁnite vorticity in the singular core.

The multivalued angular dependence of the velocity potential of
an elementary vortex ﬁlament reﬂects the non-vanishing vorticity
carried in its core.

Although the ﬁeld of a line vortex is the gradient of a single-valued velocity potential in any simply
connected region of space, the singular core carrying the vorticity makes the space around a line
vortex multiple-connected. Every closed curve may topologically be characterized by its winding
number, the number of times it circles the core. The winding number stays the same regardless of
how the curve is deformed as long as it does not cross the core.

26.3 Parallel line vortices
Vortices are not always loners like the bathtub vortex or the tornado. The advection of one vortex ﬁlament
in the ﬂow created by all the others and even by different parts of itself gives rise to a number of interesting,
beautiful and often quite counter-intuitive phenomena. Although the linearity of potential ﬂow allows us
to add the contributions from each ﬁlament, the end result can become quite complex. For parallel line
vortices the analysis is much simpler.

Complex notation
A collection of parallel line vortices is essentially two-dimensional and two-dimensional problems are often
facilitated by using complex notation. If we deﬁne the complex position and velocity ﬁelds,
w = vx − iv y ,

z = x + i y,

(26.14)

it follows from the Cartesian form of the line vortex (26.12) that the complex velocity ﬁeld of a vortex
centred at the origin is a simple pole,
−y − i x
1
C
w=C 2
= −iC
= −i .
2
x + iy
z
x +y

(26.15)

The ﬁeld of a vortex centred in another point is obtained by shifting the origin to that point.
Consider now two counter rotating parallel line vortices of strength C and −C, a distance 2b apart.
Each vortex will blow the other along with the common velocity C/2b, and thus keep a constant distance
2b between their centers. If they are positioned at y = ±b, the instantaneous complex velocity ﬁeld
becomes,
w = −i

C
2Cb
C
.
+i

z − ib
z + ib
z + b2

(26.16)

The usual velocity ﬁelds vx and v y may be calculated from the real and imaginary parts of this expression
(problem 26.3), and the streamlines of this ﬁeld are shown in ﬁgure 26.4(a ). At the origin the velocity is
2C/b which is four times the drift velocity, whereas at long distance from the vortices, r
b, the velocity
ﬁeld vanishes as 1/r 2 .
The instantaneous ﬁeld of a pair of corotating vortices of strength C a distance 2b apart will instead
blow each other in opposite directions, making the two vortex cores dance around on a circle of radius
b with angular velocity satisfying b = C/2b, or
= C/2b2 . If they are positioned at y = ±b the
instantaneous ﬁeld is,
w = −i

The streamlines of this ﬁeld are shown in ﬁgure 26.4(b). At the origin the velocity ﬁeld vanishes, whereas
at long distances from the vortices it becomes the ﬁeld of a single vortex with strength 2C.

(a) Counter-rotating vortices. The cores move horizontally at the same speed. (b) Corotating vortices.
The cores move in a circle around the centre of the ﬁgure.
The equations of motion for an arbitrary collection of line vortices may easily be written down (problem
26.5) and solved for many symmetric initial conﬁgurations, but even if the vortices move in a regular
fashion, their orbits are not necessarily stable towards small perturbations. For example, only two to six
line vortices on a ring form a stable pattern.

∗ The von Karman vortex street
Consider a long object, for example a cylinder, moving through a ﬂuid at rest with constant velocity and
with its axis orthogonal to the direction of motion. At fairly low Reynolds numbers (well above unity)
the viscous boundary layers will detach and form two counter-rotating eddies behind the object. At higher
Reynolds numbers around 100 the ﬂow behind the object becomes unstable, causing the eddies alternately
to detach at regular time intervals. Thus, in the wake of the moving object one may in a region of Reynolds
numbers observe a beautiful alternating pattern of free counter-rotating vortices shed by the object. This
pattern is called the von Karman vortex street. At still higher Reynolds numbers the instabilities become
chaotic and lead to turbulence.
First we consider an inﬁnite collection of corotating vortices of unit strength spaced regularly with
interval x = π along the x -axis. The symmetry of the chain guarantees that these vortices are not
mutually advected by each other, and the complex velocity ﬁeld becomes,
∞

w = −i
n=−∞

1
= −i cot z.
z − nπ

(26.18)

The proof that the sum equals the cotangent only requires complex function theory at a fairly elementary
level (problem 26.6).
The von Karman vortex street is now modelled by two vortex chains of strength −C at y = −b and +C
at y = b. In each chain the vortices are spaced regularly with interval 2a, but one of the chains is shifted
by a with respect to the other. The total ﬁeld becomes

This is also the velocity of the upper chain, so that in a ﬂuid at rest the whole vortex system propagates

Vibrations driven by periodic vortex shedding
The vortices periodically shed from a moving object, or a stationary object in a uniform ﬂow, act back on
the object with a force of alternating sign. Such a force is capable of driving sustained vibrations in the
object as well as in the ﬂuid surrounding it. When the driving frequency is close to a natural vibration
frequency of the object, strong vibrations may be resonantly excited, a phenomenon well known from the
‘singing’ of a taut wire in cross wind.
The Strouhal number is a dimensionless measure of the vortex shedding frequency, deﬁned from the
velocity U of the object and its effective diameter d ,
Sr =

U

(26.24)

For the von Karman vortex street with aspect ratio b/a = 0.28, d ≈ 2b and C ≈ U b we ﬁnd Sr ≈ 0.2 from
` `
(26.22), which is a typical value.
Example 26.3.1 (Piano wire): A piano wire of diameter d = 1 mm in a cross wind of U = 3 m s−1
has a Reynolds number Re ≈ 200. Taking Sr ≈ 0.2 the vortex shredding frequency becomes
f = 600 Hz which will become audible if it is close to the natural frequency of the piano wire.
A spectacular case of large-amplitude wind-driven vibrations caused the collapse of the Tacoma
Narrows bridge (Puget Sound, Washington, USA) on November 7, 1940. Although the vibrations were
originally attributed to resonant vortex shedding, it was later realized that this could not be the case. The
collapse happened when the amplitude of a torsional mode of the bridge grew beyond the limit of the
structural tolerance (see ﬁgure 26.8). On the day of the collapse the wind speed was U ≈ 20 m s−1 . With
a span thickness of d ≈ 4 m and a Strouhal number 0.2, this leads to a vortex shedding period of about
1/ f = 1 s, which is too far from the observed 5 s period of the torsional mode to be involved in the collapse.
The mechanism actually driving the amplitude of the torsional oscillation towards collapse was later shown
to be a kind of aerodynamic ﬂutter2 .

26.4 Steady vortex sustained by secondary ﬂow
Intuitively, it seems as if the natural tendency for the free vortex core to expand under the inﬂuence of
viscosity could be counteracted by a sufﬁciently strong steady radial inﬂow, vr . Since the radial inﬂow of
ﬂuid cannot accumulate at the centre of the vortex, there must also be a steady axial outﬂow, vz .
The basic mechanism shaping a steady vortex in the presence of radial inﬂow is conservation of angular
momentum. A ﬂuid particle of constant mass d M moving radially inwards at sufﬁciently high speed will
conserve its angular momentum d Äz = r vφ d M, such that it arrives at a radial distance r with a velocity
vφ ∼ 1/r . Provided the radial inﬂow is sufﬁciently strong, it will be able to maintain a constant azimuthal
ﬂow in the general shape of a line vortex, vφ ∼ 1/r , at least far from the core where the inﬂuence of
viscosity is small.

Vortex equations
In the presence of secondary ﬂow, the azimuthal equation for steady ﬂow contains non-vanishing advective
terms on the left-hand side. We shall again assume that the azimuthal velocity, vφ = vφ (r ), only depends
on r , but that vr = vr (r, z) and vz = vz (r, z) in principle may also depend on z . Using the by now
familiar methods of appendix B it is seen that the advective part of the azimuthal equation only has two
non-vanishing terms,
eφ · (v · ∇)v = vr ∇r vφ +

such that the azimuthal equation may now be written,

Since vφ only depends on r , it follows immediately from this equation that the radial ﬂow must also be
independent of z, i.e. vr = vr (r ).

where w(r ) is an arbitrary function which speciﬁes the axial ﬂow at z = 0. The second term represents the

The Burgers vortex
The vortex equation (26.25) allows us to ﬁnd the radial inﬂow necessary to maintain any azimuthal ﬂow
vφ (r ). Inserting your favorite vortex vφ (r ) into (26.25), you immediately ﬁnd the radial ﬂow vr (r ), and
afterwards you can calculate the axial ﬂow vz from (26.27), given your favourite choice of w(r ).
The complete ﬂow ﬁeld which maintains the interpolating vortex (26.5) is (for w = 0),

The scale of the secondary ﬂow is set by the inverse of the viscous core expansion time, 4ν/c2 , but
that is not particularly surprising, since the purpose of the secondary ﬂow is precisely to counteract core
expansion.

Vortex with localized axial jet
In the Burgers vortex, the axial ﬂow vz is independent of r , and that makes it very different from naturally
born vortices, such as the bathtub vortex, where the axial downﬂow must converge upon a narrow drain hole,
or the tornado where the upﬂow primarily takes place inside a narrow funnel. Here we shall consider the
extreme case of a vortex with a localized axial jet at r = 0. This vortex may be viewed as a generalization
of the line vortex (26.12) to include a steady inﬂow.
Demanding that vz = 0 outside the vortex core r > 0, it follows from (26.27) that w = 0 and
d(r vr )/dr = 0, such that the radial inﬂow must be of the form3 ,

The second term in (26.31) decays faster than the ﬁrst at inﬁnity only for α > 1, and this conﬁrms that
the radial inﬂow must be larger than a certain minimum to maintain a ﬂow in the shape of a line vortex at
large distances. In the following we assume this to be the case.

which vanishes rapidly for r > a, as it should. The azimuthal ﬁeld and the pressure can only be calculated
numerically and is pictured in ﬁgure 26.9 for a selection of values of α.
There is, as usual, a price to be paid for the construction. Although the solution interpolates perfectly
between two exact steady-ﬂow solutions to the Navier–Stokes equation, it is itself not an exact solution in
the transition region near the edge of the ‘drain pipe’ at r = a.

26.5 Advective spin-up of a vortex
It is a common observation that a vortex can be ‘spun up’ by draining ﬂuid from its central region at a steady
rate. We shall now analyse this process for a vortex with a localized axial jet and a steady radial inﬂow and
no vertical ﬂow for r > 0,

Such a ﬂow may be approximately realized in a bathtub far from the drain hole, r
a, when water is
continually being resupplied to keep a constant asymptotic water level L. The total volume inﬂux is then
Q = 2π Lq which must equal the ﬂux through the drain hole. In the following section we shall study what
happens to the bathtub vortex when the surface shape near the drain hole is taken into account.

vortex, vφ ≈ C
√
2qt , and the initial velocity proﬁle
of the vortex, albeit with a time-dependent circulation ‘constant’ C
√
is probed to farther and farther distances. The size of the region of line vortex shape grows as 2qt,
reminiscent of a diffusive process although it has nothing to do with that.
A steady vortex is never reached unless the initial speciﬁc angular momentum distribution C(r )
approaches a constant for r → ∞. These arguments show that it is in fact impossible to spin-up a
truly steady vortex by means of steady radial inﬂow, for the simple reason that it requires inﬁnite angular
momentum to be present in the ﬂow to begin with. If the angular momentum is initially ﬁnite, all of it will
sooner or later go down the drain in a non-rotating container. In a rotating container angular momentum
may be continually supplied from the moment of force exerted on the ﬂuid by the container walls, resulting
eventually in a steady ﬂow. This case was discussed in some detail in section 20.5.

Bathtub vortex: The process of getting out of a real bathtub cannot avoid leaving a certain amount
of angular momentum in the water. It is this angular momentum that the inﬂow picks up and sends
down the drain as a spinning vortex while the bathtub is being emptied (see problem 26.12). A real
bathtub vortex may change speed and even stop-up and reverse its sense of rotation depending on
the details of how you got out of the water. In a bathtub of ordinary size the incidental initial angular
momentum distribution is normally much greater than that provided by the slowly rotating Earth.
The question of the Earth’s inﬂuence on the sense of rotation of a real bathtub vortex was discussed
in section 20.6.

Bathtub-like liquid vortex with
open surface. At z = 0 there
is a drain-hole of radius a, and
the ‘tub’ has essentially inﬁnite
extension in the radial direction.
There is a central depression of
height h 0 and the asymptotic
liquid level is z = L.

A bathtub vortex is an isolated liquid vortex with an open surface, sustained by radial inﬂow and powered by
gravity4 . The most conspicuous feature of such a vortex is the central depression which may even penetrate
the drain and make audible sounds. In the laboratory such vortices can be created in rotating containers (see
section 20.5), but in this section we shall ignore the complication of container rotation and simply assume
that the primary ﬂow in the vortex is inﬁnitely extended with the shape of a line vortex, r vφ → C, at large
distances. This guarantees an unlimited supply of mass and angular momentum, such that the vortex may
be truly steady and not disappear down the drain as in real bathtubs.

Bathtub equations
In a ﬂat-Earth coordinate system with gravity directed towards negative z, the vortex is drained through a
circular region, a ‘drain hole’ of radius r = a situated at z = 0. The open liquid surface of the vortex
is assumed to be rotationally invariant, z = h(r ), and we shall again assume that the primary ﬂow is
cylindrical, vφ = vφ (r ), at least well above the bottom of the container. It follows as before that the
azimuthal ﬂow must obey the azimuthal equation (26.25), implying that the radial ﬂow is cylindrical,
vr = vr (r ), and the axial ﬂow is given by (26.27) with w(r ) being the drain ﬂow. Besides these equations
there are two boundary conditions on the open surface, one kinematic and one dynamic.
The open liquid surface with a depression at the centre forces the radial inﬂow into a region of smaller
height and thereby speeds it up in comparison with ﬂow in the axial jet vortex. Consequently, there must
exist a relation between the height of the surface, h(r ), and the radial inﬂow vr (r ). The quantitative form
of this relation is derived from the fact that the streamlines must follow the surface,
vz (r, h(r )) = vr (r )

Using (26.27) with z = h this c relation may be written,

This kinematic condition is exact in the cylindrical approximation used here.
For ‘sufﬁciently small’ secondary ﬂow the pressure gradient will be the only term in the Navier–Stokes

On the right-hand sides of both of these equations we have dropped all terms that depend on the radial and
axial ﬂow. Given that the pressure is constant p = p0 at the open surface z = h(r ), it follows from the
ﬁrst of these equations that the hydrostatic pressure takes the form, p(r, z) = p0 + ρ0 g0 (h(r ) − z). This
expression can only be valid well above the drain hole where the secondary velocities are small. Inserting
this into the second equation we ﬁnd,

A simple geometrical construction reveals the meaning of this dynamic condition: the tangential component
of gravity balances the tangential component of the centrifugal force acting on a ﬂuid particle sitting on the
rotating surface.

Choice of drain ﬂow
The three bathtub equations (26.25), (26.39) and (26.41) connect the four ﬁelds, vφ , vr , w and h. Although
the Navier–Stokes equation in principle could also provide a fourth equation (see problem 26.7), it is in view

If the argument of the square root becomes negative, there is no solution because the central dip in the
surface has plunged right through the drain, thereby violating the basic assumptions behind the model (see
also problem 26.16).
Example 26.6.1 (Bathtub vortex): A bathtub is ﬁlled with water to a height L = 50 cm. On
exiting, the bather accidentally imparts a small rotation to the water, corresponding to an average
speciﬁc angular momentum of C ≈ 20 cm2 s−1 . When the plug of radius a = 2 cm is pulled, the
water is found to drain at a rate of Q ≈ 1 litre per second. A needle-like vortex forms which according
to the above expression is L − h 0 ≈ 20 cm deep. The core diameter becomes c ≈ 3 mm and the core
is estimated to rotate about 160 turns per second!

means of (26.45) we obtain from the azimuthal vortex equation (26.25) and the centrifugal condition (26.41)

The most important technological invention of all time must be the wheel and its bearing. From the earliest
times it was realized that friction in the bearing was considerably lowered by lubricating it with viscous
ﬂuid. Wooden bearings might even catch ﬁre if not lubricated. Fat from pigs, olive oil and mineral oil
turned out to work much better than water.
When you deal a pack of cards on a table with a smooth surface, it is easy to overestimate the speed the
cards must be thrown with. Suddenly, several cards in a row slide easily over the surface and land on the
ﬂoor. The reason is that a lubricating layer of air has formed between the card and the surface of the table,
and has caused the friction you expected when throwing the card to drop nearly away. Air also lubricates
the tiny gap between the magnetic pickup heads and the rapidly spinning hard-disk in your computer and
prevents the heads from crashing into the surface. Water is used to lubricate children’s slides in amusement
parks, and sports like ice skating or curling depend crucially on a thin lubricating ﬁlm of water.
In the ﬂuid-ﬁlled gap between a moving object and a nearby solid wall, viscosity plays a dominant
role because the velocity gradients normal to the surface grow large compared to the gradients parallel to
the surface. When the gap widens towards the front of the moving object, as is normally the case, viscous
friction will drag ﬂuid into the gap, creating a pressure that can become surprisingly high. As the gap
narrows, this pressure will in the end become sufﬁcient to keep the object aﬂoat in the lubricant, thereby
securing a smooth ride.
In this chapter we shall analyse incompressible ﬂow in narrow gaps in the creeping ﬂow approximation,
ﬁrst making general estimates and afterwards solving the equations for creeping ﬂow along the lines laid
out by Reynolds already in 1886.

27.1 Physics of lubrication
Far from any boundaries, the ﬂow around an object of size L moving with velocity U through an otherwise
stationary ﬂuid of density ρ and viscosity η is characterized by the Reynolds number
Re ≈

ρUL
.
η

(27.1)

In many everyday situations—running, swimming, driving, washing dishes or babies—the Reynolds
number is very large, Re
1, and the ﬂow may be considered nearly ideal (see chapter 16).
The situation is completely different when the body moves with velocity U close to a stationary solid
boundary. If the gap width is of size d
L, the no-slip condition forces the ﬂow velocity to change rapidly
from 0 to U over this distance, and the Reynolds number in the gap becomes,
Regap ≈

because the advective acceleration in the numerator is dominated by the ﬂow variation along the gap,
whereas the Laplacian in the denominator is dominated by the ﬂow variation across the gap.
Even if the free-ﬂow Reynolds number (27.1) is large, viscous forces will dominate the ﬂow in the gap
1, or
when the distance d becomes so small that Regap

In the reference frame where the
boundary moves with velocity U ,
the object is stationary and the
ﬂow is steady.

Example 27.1.1 (Playing card): A typical playing card has size 7 cm × 10 cm, and since we do not
know how it moves we shall take L ≈ 8 cm. Skimming through the air above a horizontal table at
U ≈ 1 m s−1 , it has Re ≈ 5 × 103 and thus δ ≈ 1 mm. The condition for creeping ﬂow is fulﬁlled
when the distance to the table is somewhat less than δ, say d = 0.3 mm.
When the solid boundary is (nearly) ﬂat, the ﬂow will be steady in the rest frame of the body where the
wall moves with velocity U . We may then use the equations for steady incompressible creeping ﬂow (19.1)
without gravity
∇ p = η∇ 2 v,

∇ · v = 0.

Body with relatively ﬂat underside and a small positive angle of

be upwards. The rear of the body
will touch the ground at the rear if
αL/2 ≈ d where d is the average
width.

(27.4)

Contrary to creeping ﬂow far from the boundaries, where lift and drag are of roughly the same magnitude
(section 19.1), we shall now see that the ﬂow in a narrow gap will generate a pressure that is much larger
than the shear stress. This is in fact the secret behind lubrication: the lift will balance the weight of the body
so that it ﬂoats in the ﬂuid without generating a drag of comparable magnitude.

Estimate of lift
The magnitude of the pressure in the gap can be estimated from the equation for creeping ﬂow (27.4).
Since the double derivative across the gap dominates the Laplacian, we estimate the pressure gradient to be
|∇ p| ≈ η U/d 2 . Multiplying by the length of the gap L, we obtain the magnitude of the pressure variations
along the gap, | p| ≈ ηU L/d 2 . Finally multiplying by the gap area A, we get an estimate for the lift,

(27.3)

In chapter 28 we shall see that δ is a measure of the thickness of the boundary layer surrounding a moving
body. The conditions for creeping ﬂow will thus be fulﬁlled when the gap lies well inside the boundary
layer. In the following we shall assume this to be the case.

Here we have put in a dimensionless prefactor f of order unity, which depends on the geometry and
orientation of the body. The ﬂow around the upper part of the body will also contribute an aerodynamic lift
(see page 446). It is, however, independent of d and will in the limit of d → 0 always be dominated by the
lift from the gap.
For simplicity we shall assume that the underside of the body is reasonably ﬂat, such that it makes sense
to speak about an angle of attack α with the boundary (in section 27.2 we shall deal with the general case
of an angle of attack that varies along the body). The sign of this angle is chosen to be positive when the
gap widens towards the front of the body, and intuitively one expects in this case a positive lift that drives
the body away from the boundary. For vanishing angle of attack, the ﬂow will essentially become planar
velocity-driven Couette ﬂow (see page 232), which does not generate a lift. For negative angle of attack the
lift is also expected to be negative, causing the body to be sucked towards the boundary rather than pushed
away from it.
These arguments indicate that the prefactor in the leading approximation should be proportional to the
angle of attack, f ∼ α. Taking into account that the magnitude of this angle is limited by the requirement

Example 27.1.1 (Playing card, continued): If the playing card has mass M ≈ 2 g, and provided
the table surface is smooth, the card will sink into the boundary layer. If the shape factor is taken to
be f ≈ 0.4, the lift equals the weight for d ≈ 0.4 mm. The corresponding angle of attack becomes a
miniscule α ≈ 0.25 ◦ . The card probably has to bend slightly upwards at both ends for steady lift to be
generated. Professional card players avoid bending their cards and also cover the table with rough green
felt cloth. You never see a card skimming the table surface and landing on the ﬂoor in their company.

Estimate of skin drag
In the gap the normal velocity gradient is U/d, such that the shear stress becomes of magnitude ηU/d.
Multiplying with the area A of the gap, we obtain an estimate for the skin drag on the body from ﬂuid
friction in the gap,
skin ≈

ηU A
.
d

(27.7)

As for lift, there will also be drag from the ﬂow around the body outside the gap, but the drag from the ﬂuid
in the gap will always dominate in the limit of d → 0.
Both lift and skin drag grow with decreasing gap size, but the lift grows faster than the drag and
eventually comes to dominate it. The ratio of lift to skin drag is estimated to be,

The drag can only dominate the lift if the angle of attack is very small, α

(27.8)

Example 27.1.1 (Playing card, continued): For the playing card the actual ratio of lift to skin drag
is Ä/ skin ≈ 70 for f = 0.4. Lift would equal skin drag for f ≈ d/L, and from the balance of lift to
weight we get the corresponding ﬂying height d ≈ 6 µm. No tables are that smooth and the card will
touch down long before this level is reached.

Form drag
Besides frictional skin drag there is also a form drag from the pressure variations in the gap. Since the
pressure force is orthogonal to the body surface, the form drag may be estimated from the angle of attack
and the lift,

Ä

form ≈ α .

(27.10)

Since this is at most of order unity, we conclude that although the form drag (and lift) for ﬁxed α varies like

Example 27.1.2 (Magnetic read/write heads):
The continued sophistication in the design of
read/write heads and platter surfaces has been a major cause for the enormous improvement in hard
disk performance over the last 30 years. A typical modern (2002) hard disk has a platter diameter
of about 9 cm and runs at a speed of about 7000 rpm, leading to average platter surface speeds of
U ≈ 16 m s−1 ≈ 60 km h−1 . The read/write heads sit on the tip of an actuator arm that can roam
over the rotating platters and exchange data with the magnetic surfaces. A typical read/write head is
formed as a ﬂat wing or ‘slider’ with size L ≈ 1 mm, for which the Reynolds number comes to about

The pressure force acts orthogonally to the surface and gives rise
to normal lift as well as tangential

(27.9)

The form drag will always be positive, independent of the sign of α, because lift is proportional to α. Drag
forces should, of course, never be able to accelerate a body.
Contrary to the skin drag, which (to leading order) is independent of the angle of attack, the form drag
is quadratic in α and vanishes for α = 0. Using the estimates above we obtain the ratio of form to skin drag

Re ≈ 1000, and the maximal gap size for creeping ﬂow comes to δ ≈ 30 µm. The need for increased
data density demands smaller and smaller ﬂying height for the actual read/write device sitting on the
rear of the slider. Today (2002) it is about 0.15 µm (and even smaller), implying that the slider ﬂies
deeply inside the boundary layer. Taking the average slider gap height to be a conservative d = 1 µm
the Reynolds number in the gap becomes Regap = 10−3 which is far within the creeping ﬂow regime.
The geometry makes the angle of attack α = 0.1 degrees and the geometric prefactor f = 0.85. The
average excess pressure in the gap becomes surprisingly high, p ≈ Ä/ A ≈ 2.5 bar, implying a
lubrication lift force on the slider of Ä ≈ 0.25 N. The ratio of lift to skin plus form drag becomes
Ä/ ≈ 350. The lift force corresponds to a weight of 25 g, which must be provided by the elastic
actuator arm to keep the ﬂying height constant. If the total mass of the actuator arm and slider is of
the order of grams, such a large actuator force explains why modern hard disks can tolerate rather large
accelerations, in this example perhaps 10–20 times the acceleration of gravity.

27.2 Creeping ﬂow in a long narrow gap
Creeping ﬂow near a solid boundary is much more amenable to analytic calculations than real aerodynamics
(chapter 29). For simplicity we shall consider the essentially two-dimensional case of a stationary ‘wing’
of constant shape and ‘chord length’ L along the x -axis. The wing ‘span’ along z is denoted S such that the
total wing area is A = L S. The ‘ground’ is chosen to be perfectly ﬂat at y = 0, and moves with constant
velocity U along the x -axis. The height of the wing above the ground is given by a function y = h(x)
1. The free-ﬂow Reynolds number (27.1)
for all z, which is assumed to be slowly varying h (x)
is furthermore assumed to be so large and the height so small that the creeping approximation is valid,
L.
h(x) δ
Under these conditions we need only to retain the dominant derivatives after y in the Laplacian of
(27.4). Dropping all second derivatives after x we get a simpliﬁed set of equations for the ﬂow in the gap,

We shall now see that the right-hand side of the second equation is so small in the creeping ﬂow
approximation that the pressure to leading order is independent of y, a conclusion allowing us to solve
the gap equations analytically.

Solving the gap equations
Replacing the derivatives by ratios of suitable scales in the ﬁrst gap equation, we estimate the pressure
variation along the gap to be x p ∼ ηU L/d 2 where d is the average value of h(x). From the continuity
equation we get v y ∼ U d/L, and from the second gap equation we ﬁnd the pressure variation across
the gap, y p ∼ η v y /d ∼ ηU/L. This shows that the ratio of the pressure variations across and along
the gap is y p/ x p ∼ (d/L)2 , which by assumption is tiny. The conclusion is that to this order of
approximation we may take the pressure in the gap to be only a function of x.
Inserting p = p(x) in the ﬁrst gap equation it may immediately be integrated with the boundary
conditions vx = U at y = 0 and vx = 0 at y = h(x), yielding

Sketch of the gap pressure p(x)
in relation to d for a wing with
positive angle of attack.

The wing is supposed to move in a ﬂuid which would have constant pressure, were it not for the disturbance
created by the wing itself. Assuming that the pressure p(x) is (nearly) the same at both ends of the wing,
p ≈ 0, we obtain from (27.17) a relation between the discharge rate and the velocity,
Q=

d0 =

(27.18)

where F = (1/L) L F(x)d x denotes the average of a function F(x) along the gap. The relation between
Q and U depends on the shape of the gap only through the parameter d0 , with dimension of length. We
shall call d0 the effective gap width. For ﬂat plates with constant gap height, h(x) = h 0 , we get d0 = h 0 ,
and this shows that d0 represents the width of a gap between parallel plates, carrying the same discharge
rate as the actual gap.
The pressure gradient (27.14) may now be written
p = 6ηU

h − d0
.
h3

(27.19)

Thus, in regions where h(x) > d0 the pressure will rise, whereas it will fall in regions where h(x) < d0 .
The pressure always has an extremum in the gap.
The velocity ﬁeld may also be written

(27.20)

Whereas the ﬁrst factor is always positive, the last may have either sign.

Flow reversal
Evidently the last factor is positive for small y, but may for a given x vanish and become negative for
y > h 2 /3(h − d0 ). When this point lies inside the gap, 0 < y < h, the ﬂuid close to the wing will ﬂow
against the direction of ground motion. Evidently this is only possible for h < 3(h − d0 ), or
h(x) >

3

2 0

(27.21)

In regions where this condition is fulﬁlled, ‘rollers’ of counter-rotating ﬂuid will appear. Typically, this
happens when the gap widens locally, because the discharge rate is mainly determined by the narrow parts
of the gap, making the effective gap width d0 considerably lower than the maximal height of the bump.

with − L/2 ≤ x ≤ L/2. Instead of the parameters α and h 0 , it is more convenient to specify the extreme

It is never larger than d , and the discharge rate Q = U d0 /2 vanishes as expected, if either end of the wing
touches the ground for γ = ±1.
For positive angle of attack γ > 0, the condition for ﬂow reversal (27.21) is easiest to fulﬁll at the front
of the wing, where the left-hand side is largest. Solving the inequality for x = −L/2 we ﬁnd γ > 1/3. A
sufﬁciently large positive angle of attack will always cause ﬂow reversal at the front of the wing. Likewise,
for sufﬁciently large negative angle of attack, γ < −1/3, there will instead be ﬂow reversal at the rear of
the wing. In between for −1/3 < γ < 1/3 there is no ﬂow reversal.

γ = αL/2d. All quantities diverge logarithmically for |γ | → 1.

Drag and power
As discussed in section 27.1 the drag on the wing has two components, skin drag arising from viscous
friction and form drag arising from pressure forces projected on the direction of motion. The ‘ground’
also experiences a skin drag, but no form drag because the ground is aligned with the direction of motion.
Newton’s third law tells us that the drag forces on the wing and on the ground must be equal and opposite,
and this allows us to calculate the total drag on the wing, = skin + form , from the skin drag alone on
the ground.

The leading part of this expression agrees with the estimate (27.7). The drag estimate is modiﬁed by a γ dependent factor which converges to unity for γ → 0 and like the lift diverges logarithmically for |γ | → 1
(see ﬁgure 27.1).
The external forces that keep the ground moving with constant velocity U must be equal to the drag.
Their rate of work is
P=

U.

(27.31)

Since the wing is at rest, no other external forces perform work on the system, so this must also equal the
total rate of dissipation into heat. In ﬁgure 27.1 the shape factor for the rate of dissipation as a function of
γ is the same as the shape factor for the drag.

ground, destabilizing the ﬂight.

negative. Eventually, the card may catch on surface irregularities and turn over, showing its value, to

27.4 Loaded journal bearing
In section 18.6 we discussed the case of laminar ﬂow between two concentric rotating cylinders—the
prototypical journal bearing. If the inner shaft or the outer sleeve (bushing) carries a load orthogonal
to the shaft, the cylinders will no more be concentric, although we shall assume that they are still parallel
with respect to each other.
In a non-rotating journal bearing the lubricating ﬂuid will be squeezed out and the shaft will come into
direct contact with the sleeve at a point opposite the direction of the load. When the shaft (or the sleeve)
is brought into rotation, ﬂuid will be dragged along due to the no-slip condition and forced into the narrow
part of the gap, thereby creating a pressure that tends to lift the shaft away from the sleeve. As we shall see,
the lift will not be directed orthogonally to the point of contact at rest.
In this section we only discuss laminar ﬂow in the gap. A rotating journal bearing is also prone to the
centrifugal instabilities discussed in section 18.7 on page 262 with formation of Taylor vortices and more
complicated structures.

Narrow gap approximation
Let the inner cylinder have radius a and the outer radius b > a with a difference d = b − a that is assumed
to be tiny, d
a. In a coordinate system with the z-axis coinciding with the axis of the inner cylinder, we
may without loss of generality assume that the point of closest approach takes place on the positive x-axis.
Denoting the centre of the outer cylinder x = −c, the points of the outer cylinder are determined by the
equation (x + c)2 + y 2 = b2 . In standard cylindrical coordinates this becomes r 2 + c2 + 2r c cos φ = b2 ,
which to ﬁrst order in the small quantity c has the solution r = b − c cos φ, and the width of the gap
h = r − a between the cylinders becomes
h = d − c cos φ.

(27.33)

It is convenient to introduce the dimensionless eccentricity parameter,
γ =

c
d

(27.34)

which must lie in the interval −1 ≤ γ ≤ 1.
The shaft has length S, area A = 2πaS, and rotates at constant angular velocity with surface velocity
U = a . Disregarding the possibility that lubricant may be squeezed out along the z-axis (a non-trivial
technical detail), the problem is essentially two-dimensional. We shall assume that the longitudinal ﬁeld
vanishes, vz = 0, and the azimuthal and radial ﬁelds, vφ and vr , depend only on r and φ. In this
approximation, the general theory of ﬂow in a narrow gap (section 27.2) may be brought into play, replacing
x by aφ and y by s = r − a. The narrow gap between the cylinders has essentially been converted to a
ﬂat-wall gap of length L = 2πa with strictly periodic boundary conditions.
The effective gap width deﬁned in (27.18) may now be evaluated by averaging over φ, with the result
(see problem 27.6),
d0 = d

Figure 27.2. Orientation-dependent shape factors for lift and dissipated power in a journal bearing as a

As for the ﬂat plate the volume discharge is Q = U d0 /2 and it vanishes as expected for γ = ±1 when the
two cylinders come into contact.

Pressure and lift

Evidently the pressure vanishes at the point of closest approach φ = 0 and at the opposite point φ = π.
If γ > 0, the pressure is positive in the lower half of the gap and negative in the upper. The up-down
antisymmetry of the pressure under φ → −φ implies that the average pressure is zero, p = 0.
In Cartesian coordinates the surface element of the inner cylinder is d S = (cos φ, sin φ, 0) adφ dz. The
up-down antisymmetry of p shows that the lift along x vanishes,

estimate (27.5). The behaviour of the shape factor is shown in ﬁgure 27.2. It is nearly linear in the interval
−0.9 < γ < 0.9, outside which it diverges rapidly. The divergence permits, in principle, the bearing to
carry any load by adjusting γ to be sufﬁciently close to unity.
It is perhaps a bit counterintuitive that the lift is always parallel with the direction of motion at the
point of closest approach, rather than orthogonal to it. This is, as we have seen, a consequence of the
antisymmetry of the pressure with respect to the radial direction at closest approach. When the shaft
just starts to rotate from rest, the direction of lift will thus be orthogonal to the direction of load,
and with no other forces at play, this lift will tend to shift the point of closest approach sideways in
the direction of motion of the shaft surface. As the point of closest approach moves away the lift

Moment of drag and power
The shear stress σφr at the surface of the shaft is given by the general expression (27.29). In this case it
makes no sense to speak about a drag force, but rather the moment of the shear stress around the centre of

Between the two extremes of sluggish creeping ﬂow at low Reynolds number and lively ideal ﬂow at high,
there is a regime in which neither is dominant. At large Reynolds number, the ﬂow will be nearly ideal
almost everywhere, except near solid boundaries where the no-slip condition requires the speed of the ﬂuid
to match the speed of the boundary wall. Here transition layers will arise in which the ﬂow velocity changes
rapidly from the velocity of the wall to the velocity of the ﬂow in the ﬂuid at large. Boundary layers are
typically thin compared to the radii of curvature of the solid walls, and that simpliﬁes the basic equations.
In a boundary layer the character of the ﬂow thus changes from creeping near the boundary to ideal well
outside. The most interesting and also most difﬁcult physics characteristically takes place in such transition
regions. But humans live out their lives in nearly ideal ﬂows of air and water at Reynolds numbers in the
millions with boundary layers only millimetres thick, and are normally not conscious of them. Smaller
animals eking out an existence at the surface of a stone in a river may be much more aware of the vagaries
of boundary layer physics which may inﬂuence their body shapes and internal layout of organs.
Boundary layers serve to insulate bodies from the ideal ﬂow that surrounds them. They have a
‘life of their own’ and may separate from the solid walls and wander into regions containing only ﬂuid.
Detached layers may again split up, creating complicated unsteady patterns of whirls and eddies. Advanced
understanding of ﬂuid mechanics begins with an understanding of boundary layers. Systematic boundary
layer theory was initiated by Prandtl in 1904 and has in the twentieth century become a major subtopic of
ﬂuid mechanics [61, 64, 79].
In this chapter we shall mainly focus on the theory of incompressible laminar boundary layers without
heat ﬂow. A semi-empirical discussion of turbulent boundary layers is also included.

28.1 Physics of boundary layers
The no-slip condition forces the velocity of a ﬂuid to vanish at a static solid wall. Under many—but not
all—circumstances, the transition between the rapid ﬂow at high Reynolds number in the ﬂuid at large and
the stagnation at the wall will take place in a thin boundary layer hugging the wall. Close to the wall, the
velocity ﬁeld is so small that the ﬂow pattern will always be laminar, in fact creeping, with the velocity ﬁeld
rising linearly from zero. The laminar ﬂow may extend all the way to the edge of the boundary layer, or it
may become turbulent if the Reynolds number is sufﬁciently large.

Laminar boundary layer thickness
Denoting the typical velocity of the mainstream ﬂow by U , the Reynolds number is as usual Re ≈ U L/ν
where L is the length scale for signiﬁcant changes in the ﬂow, determined by the geometry of bodies and
containers. We shall always assume that it is large, Re

Here the numerator is estimated from the change in mainstream velocity along the wall over a distance L,

Since the boundary layer represents the transition region from essentially non-viscous ﬂow at large with
Re

This estimate is valid up to a coefﬁcient of order unity which will be discussed later (section 28.4). For
large mainstream Reynolds number, Re
1, the thickness of the boundary layer will thus be considerably
smaller than the typical length scale of the mainstream ﬂow.
Example 28.1.1: The Reynolds numbers for ﬂows we encounter in daily life easily reach into the
millions, making the laminar boundary layer thickness smaller than a thousandth of the scale of the ﬂow.
Jogging or swimming, one hardly notes the existence of boundary layers that are only millimetres thick.

Wall shear stress
In the laminar boundary layer, the velocity rises linearly with the distance from the boundary in the same
way as in planar velocity-driven ﬂow. The normal velocity gradient at the wall is approximately U/δ, and
multiplying by the viscosity we obtain an estimate of the shear stress on the wall,
σwall ≈ η

The wall stress thus increases as U 3/2 with increasing mainstream velocity U and as

Initial viscous growth
When a body at rest is suddenly set into motion at t = 0 with velocity U , the ﬂuid in its immediate vicinity
will have to follow along to satisfy the no-slip boundary condition. Large velocity gradients and therefore
large stresses will arise in the ﬂuid next to the body, and these stresses will cause ﬂuid layers farther out
also to be dragged along. Eventually this process may come to an end and the ﬂow will become steady. In
the beginning the newly created boundary layer is extremely thin, so that the general geometry of the ﬂow
and the shape of the body cannot matter. This indicates that suddenly created boundary layers always start
out their growth in the same universal way.
To estimate the universal growth of the boundary layer thickness δ(t), we use that at time t the ﬂuid at
the edge of the boundary layer will have changed its velocity from 0 to U , making the local acceleration of
order U/t. The ratio between the local and advective acceleration then becomes,

The time the ﬂuid takes to pass the body is L/U . For times much shorter than this, t

A suddenly created boundary layer always starts out like this, growing with the square root of time. This
behaviour is typical of viscous diffusion processes (page 233).
After the initial universal growth, the boundary layer comes to depend on the general geometry of the
ﬂow for t ≈ L/U , when the estimate reaches the steady layer thickness (28.2). It takes more careful
analysis to see whether the ﬂow eventually ‘goes steady’, or whether instabilities arise, leading to a radical
change in the character of the ﬂow, such as boundary layer separation or turbulence.

Merging boundary layers
The increase of a boundary layer’s thickness with downstream distance implies that the boundary layer
around an inﬁnite body must become inﬁnitely thick or at least so thick that it ﬁlls out all the available
space. In steady planar ﬂow between moving plates (section 17.1), we saw that the velocity proﬁle of the
ﬂuid interpolates linearly between the plate velocities, and there is nothing like a boundary layer with ﬁnite
thickness near the plates. Likewise, in pressure-driven steady planar ﬂow or pipe ﬂow (sections 18.2 and
18.4), the exact shape of the velocity proﬁle is parabolic (as long as the ﬂow is laminar), whatever the
viscosity of the ﬂuid. Again we see no trace of a ﬁnite boundary layer in the exact solutions. Completely
merged boundary layers are, however, only found in inﬁnite systems. In a pipe of ﬁnite length the boundary
layers grow out from the walls, starting at the entrance to the pipe and eventually merge at a distance, called
the entrance length, which we estimated on page 254.

(28.7)

This shows that the boundary layer grows thicker downstream, even if the mainstream ﬂow is completely
uniform and independent of x. Disregarding sound waves, the time t = x/U it takes the ﬂow to pass
through the distance x is also the earliest moment that the leading edge can causally inﬂuence the ﬂow
near x. Intuitively one might say that the universal viscous growth of the boundary layer is curtailed by the
encounter with the blast of undisturbed ﬂuid coming in from afar.
Boundary layers have a natural tendency towards downstream thickening, because they build up along a
body in a cumulative fashion. Having reached a certain thickness, a boundary layer acts as a not-quite-solid
‘wall’ on which another boundary layer will form. The thickness of a steady boundary layer is also strongly
dependent on whether the mainstream ﬂow is accelerating or decelerating along the body, behaviour which
in turn is determined by the geometry. If the mainstream ﬂow accelerates, i.e. grows with x, the boundary
layer tends to remain thin. This happens at the front of a moving body, where the ﬂuid must speed up to
get out of the way. Conversely, towards the rear of the body, where the mainstream ﬂow again decelerates
in order to ‘ﬁll up the hole’ left by the passing body, the boundary layer becomes rapidly thicker, and may
even separate from the body, creating an unsteady, even turbulent, trailing wake. The von K` rm` n vortex
a a
street (page 381) is an example of periodic unsteady ﬂow in the wake of a body.

edge orthogonal to a uniform mainstream ﬂow (solved analytically in section 28.4). Here the only possible

Mainstream acceleration in a
converging channel produces a
downwash of ﬂuid, and conversely in a diverging channel.

Upwelling and downwash
Inside a boundary layer, at a ﬁxed distance from a ﬂat solid wall with a uniform mainstream velocity
U , the ﬂow decelerates downstream as the boundary layer thickens due to the action of viscosity. Mass
conservation requires a compensating upwelling of ﬂuid into the ﬂuid at large. If, on the other hand, the
boundary is permeable and ﬂuid is sucked down through it at a constant rate, the upﬂow can be avoided,
and a steady boundary layer of constant thickness may be created (problem 28.1).
The mainstream ﬂow is determined by bodies and containers that guide the ﬂuid and will generally
not be uniform but rather accelerate or decelerate along the boundaries. An accelerating mainstream ﬂow
will counteract the natural deceleration in the boundary layer and may even overwhelm it, leading to a
downwash towards the boundary. Mainstream acceleration thus tends to stabilize a boundary layer so that
it has less tendency to thicken, and may lead to constant or even diminishing thickness. Conversely, if the
mainstream ﬂow decelerates, this will add to the natural deceleration in the boundary layer and increase its
thickness as well as the upwelling.

Separation
Even at very moderate mainstream deceleration, the upwelling can become so strong that at some point the
ﬂuid ﬂowing in the mainstream direction cannot feed it. Some of the ﬂuid in the boundary layer will then
have to ﬂow against the mainstream ﬂow. Between the forward and reversed ﬂows there will be a separation
line ending in a stagnation point on the wall. Such ﬂow reversal was also noted in lubrication (page 399),
although there are no boundary layers in creeping ﬂow.
In the region of reversed ﬂow, the velocity still has to vanish right at the boundary. Moving up from the
boundary wall, the ﬂow ﬁrst moves backwards with respect to the mainstream, but farther from the wall it
must again turn back to join up with the mainstream. The velocity gradient must accordingly be negative
right at the boundary in the reversal region, corresponding to a negative wall stress σwall . At the separation
point the wall stress must necessarily vanish, but ﬂow reversal can in principle take place entirely within
the boundary layer without proper separation, for example at a dent in the wall.

28.2. THE STOKES LAYER

411

Turbulence
Boundary layers can also become turbulent. Turbulence efﬁciently mixes ﬂuid in all directions. The orderly
layers of ﬂuid that otherwise isolate the wall from the mainstream ﬂow all but disappear, and on average,
the mainstream velocity will press much closer to the wall. Turbulence typically sets in downstream from
the front of body when the laminar boundary layer has grown so thick that the local Reynolds number (for
typical ﬂow variations of size δ ),
Uδ
,
Reδ =
ν

(28.8)

becomes large enough, say in the thousands. In a laminar boundary layer, the estimate (28.2) shows that
Re ∼ Re2 , so that turbulence will not arise in the boundary layer until the mainstream Reynolds number
δ
reaches a million or more, which incidentally is just about the range in which humans and many of their
machines operate.
Although the turbulent velocity ﬂuctuations press close to the wall, there will always remain a thin
viscous, nearly laminar, sublayer close to the wall, in which the average velocity gradient normal to the
wall rises linearly with distance. Since the mainstream velocity on average comes much closer to the wall,
the average wall stress will be much larger than in a completely laminar boundary layer. The skin drag
on a body is consequently expected to increase when the boundary layer becomes turbulent, though other
changes in the ﬂow may interfere and instead cause an even larger drop in the form drag at a particular
value of the Reynolds number, as we saw in the discussion of the ‘drag crisis’ (page 274).

28.2 The Stokes layer
The initial growth of the boundary layer at a ﬂat plate suddenly set into motion (Stokes ﬁrst problem) must
also follow the universal law (28.6). In this case there is no intrinsic length scale for the geometry, and
the transition to geometry-dependent steady ﬂow cannot take place. The planar boundary layer, called the
Stokes layer, can for this reason be expected to provide a clean model for the universal viscous growth.

Analytic solution
As usual it is best to view the system from the reference frame in which the plate and the ﬂuid initially
move with the same velocity U and the plate is suddenly stopped at t = 0. Assuming that the ﬂow is
planar with vx = vx ( y, t) and v y = 0, the Navier–Stokes equation for incompressible ﬂow reduces to the
momentum-diffusion equation (17.5), which is repeated here for convenience
∂vx
∂ 2 vx
=ν 2 .
∂t
∂y

(28.9)

The linearity of this equation guarantees that the velocity everywhere must be proportional to U , and since
there is no intrinsic length or time scale in the deﬁnition of the problem, the velocity ﬁeld must be of the
form,
vx (y, t) = U f (s),

y
s= √ .
2 νt

(28.10)

The so far unknown function f (s) should obey the boundary conditions f (0) = 0 and f (∞) = 1. The
factor two in the denominator is just a convenient choice.
Upon insertion of (28.10) into (28.9) we are led to an ordinary second-order differential equation for
f (s),
f (s) + 2s f (s) = 0.

(28.11)

Viewed as a ﬁrst-order equation for f (s), it has the unique solution f (s) ∼ exp(−s 2 ). Integrating this
expression once more over s and applying the boundary conditions, the ﬁnal result becomes

the velocity proﬁle rises linearly

Gaussian tail
For large values the error function approaches unity with a Gaussian tail, 1 − f (s) ∼ exp(−s 2 ) =
exp(−y 2 /4νt), typical of momentum diffusion. The Gaussian tail extends all the way to spatial inﬁnity
for any positive time, t > 0, but how can that be, when the plate was only brought to stop at time t = 0?
Will it take a ﬁnite time for this event to propagate to spatial inﬁnity? The short answer is that we have
assumed the ﬂuid to be incompressible, and this—fundamentally untenable—assumption will in itself entail
inﬁnite signal speeds. At a deeper level, a diffusion equation like (28.9) is the statistical continuum limit of
the dynamics of random molecular motion in the ﬂuid, and although extremely high molecular speeds are
strongly damped, they may in principle occur. The effective limit to diffusion speed is, as discussed before,
always set by the ﬁnite speed of sound.

When the plate was still moving for t < 0, stopped, the ﬂow was everywhere irrotational. Afterwards there
is evidently vorticity everywhere in the boundary layer. Where did that come from?
Consider a (nearly) inﬁnite rectangle with support of length L on the plate. By Stokes’ theorem the
total ﬂux of vorticity (or circulation) through the rectangle is = ω · d S = v · d . The ﬂuid velocity
always vanishes on the plate, is orthogonal to the sides and approaches the constant U at inﬁnity, so that we
obtain = −U L. Since the circulation is constant in time, vorticity is not generated inside the boundary
layer itself during its growth, but rather at the plate surface during the instantaneous deceleration to zero
velocity. If the plate did not stop with inﬁnite deceleration, but followed a gentler road U (t) from U to 0,
the circulation (t) = (U (t) − U )L would also have decreased gently from 0 to −U L. The conclusion is
that vorticity is generated at the plate surface during the deceleration, and afterwards it diffuses away from
the plate and into the ﬂuid at large without changing the total circulation.

Thickness

√
The velocity ﬁeld is self-similar because it only depends on the dimensionless variable s = y/2 νt . At
√
different times the velocity proﬁles only differ by the ‘vertical’ length scale 2 νt. There is no cut-off in
the inﬁnitely extended Gaussian tail and therefore no ‘true’ thickness δ. Conventionally, one deﬁnes the
boundary layer thickness to be the distance where the velocity has reached 99% of the terminal velocity.
The solution to f (s) = 0.99 is s = 1.82 . . . (see ﬁgure 28.2(b)), such that

28.3. BOUNDARY LAYER THEORY

413

28.3 Boundary layer theory
When Prandtl introduced the concept of boundary layers he pointed out that there were simplifying features,
allowing for less complicated equations. The greater simplicity comes from the assumption of nearly ideal
mainstream ﬂow with Re
1, which according to the estimate (28.2) implies that boundary layers are thin,
i.e. δ
L where L is the length scale for variations in the mainstream ﬂow.
We shall—as Prandtl did—consider only the two-dimensional case with an inﬁnitely extended planar
boundary wall at y = 0 and a unidirectional mainstream ﬂow along x. In the absence of viscosity, the
incompressible ﬂuid would slip along the boundary, y = 0, with a slowly varying slip-velocity, vx = U (x).
Leaving out gravity, it follows from Bernoulli’s theorem (16.15) that there must be an associated slip-ﬂow
pressure at the boundary,
P(x) = P0 − 1 ρ0 U (x)2 ,
2

(28.15)

where P0 is a constant. The slip-ﬂow pressure simply reﬂects the variation in slip-velocity along the
boundary.

The Prandtl equations
In viscous ﬂow the no-slip condition demands that the true velocity must change rapidly from vx = 0 right
δ. Formulated more carefully, the
at the boundary y = 0 to vx = U (x) outside the boundary layer y
slip-ﬂow velocity U (x) and boundary pressure P(x) should now be understood as describing the ﬂow in the
region δ
y
L, well outside the boundary layer but still so close to the boundary that the mainstream
L, ﬂow and pressure come to depend on the
ﬂow depends mainly on x. In the mainstream proper, for y
general ﬂow geometry with other length scales for major ﬂow variations along both x and y.
The continuity equation,

²

determines the upﬂow v y both inside and outside the boundary layer. Integrating over y, and using the
boundary condition v y = 0 for y = 0, we obtain the exact relation,
v y (x, y) = −

y
∂
vx (x, y ) d y .
∂x 0

(28.17)

Since major ﬂow variations take place on the length scales L along x and δ along y, this equation permits
√
us to estimate the upﬂow to be of magnitude v y ∼ U δ/L ∼ U/ Re. The upﬂow inside the boundary layer
will thus for Re
1 be much smaller than the slip-ﬂow.
Mass conservation implies that the upﬂow inside the boundary layer continues into the slip-ﬂow region

(U (x) − vx (x, y)) d y.

(28.19)

In the last step we have replaced the upper limit y by L under the assumption that U − vx vanishes rapidly
outside the boundary layer for y δ.
The quantity Q(x) represents the volume of the slip-ﬂow displaced by the boundary layer per unit of
time (and per unit of length along z). The upﬂow (28.18) in the slip-ﬂow region thus has two contributions,
one from the variations in slip-ﬂow and one from the boundary layer itself. The latter represents the natural
upwelling in the boundary layer discussed on page 410.

In either of these equations, the double derivative after y is proportional to 1/δ 2 , whereas the double
1.
derivative after x is proportional to 1/L 2 , making it a factor 1/Re smaller and thus negligible for Re
Setting vx ≈ U and v y ≈ U δ/L we estimate from any of the remaining terms in the second equation that
the normal pressure gradient is ∂ p/∂ y ≈ ρ0 U 2 δ/L 2 . Finally, multiplying this expression with δ we obtain
1
the pressure variation across the boundary layer y p ≈ δ ∂ p/∂ y ≈ ρ0 U 2 δ 2 /L 2 ∼ ρ0 U 2 /Re. For Re
this is much smaller than the typical variation in slip-ﬂow pressure P ≈ ρ0 U 2 and may be disregarded.
In this approximation the true pressure in the boundary layer equals the slip-ﬂow pressure everywhere,
p(x, y) ≈ P(x). The slip-ﬂow pressure appears to be ‘stiff’, and penetrates the boundary layer to act
directly on the boundary.
Inserting p = P in (28.20a) and dropping the second order derivative after x, we arrive at Prandtl’s
momentum equation,

Since v y is given in terms of vx by (28.17), we have obtained a single integro-differential equation which
for any given U (x) determines vx , subject to the boundary conditions vx = 0 for y = 0 and vx → U
for y → ∞. The preceding analysis shows that the correction terms to this equation are of order 1/Re.
The Prandtl approximation, however, breaks down near a separation point, where the upﬂow becomes
comparable to the mainﬂow.

28.4 The Blasius layer
Paul Richard Heinrich Blasius
(1883–1970). German physicist,
a student of Prandtl’s. Worked
on boundary-layer drag and on
smooth pipe resistance.

The generic example of a steady laminar boundary layer is furnished by a semi-inﬁnite plate with its edge
orthogonal to a uniform ﬂow with constant velocity U , a problem ﬁrst solved by Blasius in 1908.

Self-similarity
As the main variation in vx happens across the boundary layer, it may be convenient to measure y in units
√
of the thickness of the boundary layer, estimated to be of order δ ∼ νx/U in (28.7). Let us for this reason
write the velocity in dimensionless self-similar form,
vx (x, y) = U f (s),

s=y

U
,
2νx

(28.22)

where f (s) must satisfy the boundary conditions, f (0) = 0 and f (∞) = 1. The factor of two in the
square root is conventional. In principle, the function could also depend on the dimensionless variable
Rex = U x/ν, but the correctness of the above assumption will be justiﬁed by ﬁnding a solution satisfying
the boundary conditions.

v y (x, y) = h(s)

Uν

2x

(28.24)

with
h(s) = s f (s) − g(s).

(28.25)

The asymptotic value h(∞) = lims→∞ (s − g(s)) determines the total upﬂow injected into the mainstream
by the boundary layer.

Blasius’ equation
Finally, v y is inserted into the Prandtl equation (28.21) and using that in this case U is constant, we obtain
a single third-order ordinary differential equation, called the Blasius equation,
g (s) + g(s)g (s) = 0,

(28.26)

which must be solved with the boundary conditions g(0) = 0, g (0) = f (0) = 0, and g (∞) = f (∞) = 1.
Numeric integration yields the results shown in ﬁgure 28.3 and 28.4.

Numeric trick: The condition g (∞) = 1 seems at ﬁrst a bit troublesome to implement
numerically. The trick is ﬁrst to ﬁnd the solution g(s) which satisﬁes the Blasius equation with
with g (0) = 1. This solution converges at inﬁnity to a value a 2 ≡ g (∞) = 1.65519 . . . instead of
unity. The correct solution is ﬁnally obtained by the transformation,
g(s) =

It is a simple matter to verify that this function also satisﬁes the Blasius equation.

signals breakdown of the boundary layer approximation at the leading edge of the plate.

Laminar skin drag on a ﬂat wing
Consider now an inﬁnitely thin rectangular ‘wing’ with ‘chord’ L in the direction of ﬂow, and a ‘span’
S orthogonal to the ﬂow (in the z-direction). Such an object generates no form drag, when it is aligned

with the ﬂow, and disregarding the inﬂuence of the rear and side edges of the wing, the total (skin) drag is
obtained by integrating σwall = (1/2)ρ0 U 2 C f (x) over both sides of the plate,

(28.32)

where A = L S is the wing’s area and Re = U L/ν is its Reynolds number. The skin drag coefﬁcient
decreases with the square root of the Reynolds number, and is of little importance in most everyday
situations with Reynolds number in the millions. Mostly the skin drag is overwhelmed by the form drag
coefﬁcient which does not decrease but rather stays constant for Re → ∞.
Example 28.4.1 (Weather vane): A little rectangular metal weather vane with sides L = 30 cm and
S = 20 cm in a U = 10 m s−1 wind has Re = U L/ν ≈ 2 × 105 , well below the onset of turbulence.
The drag coefﬁcient becomes C ≈ 6 × 10−3 , and the total skin drag ≈ 0.02 N, when the vane is
aligned with the wind. This drag corresponds to a weight of merely 2 g, whereas the form drag and the
other aerodynamic forces that align the vane are much stronger. One should certainly not dimension the
support of the vane on the basis of the laminar skin drag!

28.5 Turbulent boundary layer in uniform ﬂow
Sufﬁciently far downstream from the leading edge, the Reynolds number, Rex = U x/ν , will eventually
grow so large that the boundary layer becomes turbulent. Empirically, the transition happens for 5 × 105
Rex
3 × 106 , depending on the circumstances, for example the uniformity of the mainstream ﬂow and
the roughness of the plate surface. We shall in the following discussion take Rex = 5 × 105 as the nominal
transition point.
The line of transition across the plate is not a straight line parallel with the z -axis, but rather an irregular,
time-dependent, jagged, even fractal interface between the laminar and turbulent regions. This is also the
case for the extended, nearly ‘horizontal’ interface between the turbulent boundary layer and the ﬂuid at
large. Such intermittent and fractal behaviour is common to the onset of turbulence in all systems.

º

Friction coefﬁcient
In a turbulent boundary layer, the true velocity ﬁeld v ﬂuctuates in all directions and in time around
some mean value. Even very close to the wall, there will be notable ﬂuctuations. The no-slip condition
nevertheless has to be fulﬁlled and a thin sublayer dominated by viscous stresses must exist close to
the wall. In this viscous sublayer the average velocity vx rises linearly from the surface with a slope,
¯
¯
∂ vx /∂ y| y=0 = σwall /η that can be determined from drag measurements.

(28.33)

The turbulent friction coefﬁcient thus decreases much slower than the corresponding laminar friction
coefﬁcient (28.31). The two expressions cross each other at Rex ≈ 7800 which is far below the transition
to turbulence, implying a jump from C f ≈ 9.4 × 10−4 to C f ≈ 4.1 × 10−3 at Rex ≈ 5 × 105 . Turbulent
boundary layers thus cause much more skin drag than laminar boundary layers (by a factor of more than
four at the nominal transition point).
In ﬁgure 28.5 the friction coefﬁcient is plotted across the laminar and turbulent regimes. The transition
from laminar to turbulent is in reality not nearly as sharp as shown here, partly because of the average over
the jagged transition line. Eventually, for sufﬁciently large Re x , the roughness of the plate surface makes
the friction coefﬁcient nearly independent of viscosity and thus of Rex .

the nominal points Rex = 5 × 105 and at Rex = 109 are in reality softer than shown here. The position of
the second transition and the terminal value of C f depend on the roughness of the plate surface (see [80]
for details).

Drag on a ﬂat wing
Let us again consider a ﬁnite ‘wing’ of size A = L ×S. For sufﬁciently large Reynolds number Re = U L/ν,
the boundary layer will always become turbulent some distance downstream from the the leading edge, and
the drag will in general be dominated by the turbulent boundary layer’s larger friction coefﬁcient. Assuming
a fully turbulent boundary layer, the dimensionless turbulent drag coefﬁcient becomes (including both sides
of the plate)

If the leading laminar boundary layer cannot be disregarded, this expression is somewhat modiﬁed.
Example 28.5.1 (Flag blowing in the wind): A A = 2 × 2 m2 ﬂag in a U = 10 m s−1 wind has a
Reynolds number of Re ≈ 1.3 × 106 , well inside the turbulent region. The laminar skin drag coefﬁcient
is C ≈ 2.3 × 10−3 whereas the turbulent skin drag coefﬁcient is C ≈ 8.4 × 10−3 . The turbulent
≈ 1.68 N which seems much too small to keep the ﬂag straight. But ﬂags tend
skin drag is only
to ﬂap irregularly in the wind, thereby adding a much larger average form drag to the total drag, and
giving them even in a moderate wind the nearly straight form that we admire so much.

x1
x2
The drag on the plate between
x1 and x2 must equal the rate of
loss of momentum from the ﬂuid
between the dashed lines.

Local drag and momentum balance
Momentum balance guarantees that the drag on any section of the plate, say for x1 < x < x2 , must equal the
rate of momentum loss from the slice of ﬂuid above this interval, independent of whether the ﬂuid is laminar
or turbulent. Formally, we may use the Prandtl equations to derive such a relation for an inﬁnitesimal slice
of the boundary layer, as was ﬁrst done by von Karman in 1921.
For constant slip-ﬂow it follows trivially from (28.16) and (28.21) that

By construction, this expression is continuous across the nominal transition point (see ﬁgure 28.6).

The ‘true’ thickness δν of the viscous sublayer is obtained from
the intercept between Prandtl’s
power proﬁle (28.37) and the linearly rising velocity in the sublayer. The kink at y = δν
is unphysical, because it gives
rise to a small jump in shear
stress that violates Newton’s third
law (slightly). The real transition from viscous sublayer to turbulent main layer is softer than
shown here.

The viscous sublayer
It is also possible to get an estimate of the thickness δν of the viscous sublayer from the intercept between

∗ 28.6 Self-similar boundary layers
In the two preceding sections we have only discussed the case of constant slip-ﬂow, but now we turn to the
study of slip-ﬂows that vary with x. In this section we shall focus on the generalization of the self-similar
laminar Blasius solution to non-constant ﬂat-plate slip-ﬂow U (x). The assumption of self-similarity has
before allowed us to convert the partial differential equations of ﬂuid mechanics into ordinary differential
equations. We shall now see that self-similarity implies that the Prandtl equations essentially only permit
power law slip-ﬂows of the form U ∼ x m . The class of such slip-ﬂows is on the other hand sufﬁciently
general to illustrate what happens when a slip-ﬂow accelerates (m > 0) or decelerates (m < 0), although it
cannot handle the separation phenomenon.

where f (s) is a dimensionless function of the dimensionless variable. The velocity scale is set by U (x)
and the scale of the boundary layer thickness by δ(x). As for the Blasius layer we choose the boundary
conditions to be f (0) = 0 and f (∞) = 1. In the following we suppress the x -dependence wherever
possible.
It follows immediately from the equation of continuity (28.17) that
vy = −

∂
(U δ g),
∂x

(28.46)

where g(s) is again given by (28.23). Substituting vx and v y into the Prandl equation (28.21) we obtain
after a little algebra the coupled ordinary differential equations,
f + α g f + β(1 − f 2 ) = 0,

g = f,

(28.47)

where a prime indicates the derivative with respect to s . Using a dot to denote the derivative after x , the
purely numerical coefﬁcients become,
α=

and may by construction be x -dependent. The crucial point is now that since f (s) and g(s) only depend on
s , it follows from the differential equation (28.47) that both α and β must in fact be independent of x .
The deﬁnitions (28.48) may thus be viewed as two coupled ordinary differential equations for δ and U
with constant values of α and β . To solve them we ﬁrst note that they imply d(δ 2 U )/d x = (2α − β)ν.
For α > 0 we may without loss of generality rescale δ such that we get α = 1. Integrating we now obtain
δ 2 U = (2 − β)ν x where for β = 2 we choose the origin of x such that integration constant vanishes.
˙
Inserting this into the second equation in (28.48), it follows that β = (2 − β)x U / U , implying that U ∼ x m
with m = β/(2 − β). Putting it all together, the allowed class is given by,
U (x) = Ax m ,

δ(x) =

solutions has since been extensively studied [61, 64]. A selection of proﬁles are shown in ﬁgure 28.7 for a
few values of m. We leave it as an exercise to discuss the other families of solutions with α ≤ 0 or β = 2.

Upﬂow
A non-constant inviscid slip-ﬂow vx = U (x) generates by itself (and mass conservation) an upﬂow
˙
˙
v y = −y U (x). The part of the upﬂow due to the presence of a boundary layer is consequently v y + y U ,
which may be written in the form

˙
v y + y U (x) = h(s),
δ
h(s) = s f (s) − g(s) + βs(1 − f (s)).

(28.51)
(28.52)

This reduces to the Blasius result (28.24) for β = 0. Since for s → ∞ we expect that f (s) → 1 with an
exponential tail, this function converges for s → ∞ to a ﬁnite value, h(∞) = lims→∞ (s − g(s)).

Figure 28.7. Self-similar Falkner–Skan velocity proﬁles f (s) for select values of m c < m < ∞ where
m c = −0.0904286. The Blasius proﬁle is obtained for m = 0. Note that there are two solutions for each
value of m in the interval m c < m < 0, one of which has reversed ﬂow close to the wall. The critical proﬁle
with m = m c is shown dashed.

Numeric method and results
Numeric integration of the Falkner–Skan equation is reasonably straightforward using a ‘ballistic’ method
of integration. The integration process is initiated with g(0) = f (0) = 0 and f (0) = µ, and a search is
made for the value of the slope µ that yields f (∞) = 1. In the same way as there are two elevation angles
that may be used to hit a target with a cannon ball, there may be more than one solution to the Falkner–Skan
equation for certain values of m.
In ﬁgure 28.7 the velocity proﬁle is shown for a selection of m -values and in ﬁgure 28.8 the wall slope
f (0) and asymptotic upﬂow h(∞) are plotted as a function of m in the interval −0.1 < m < 0.2. The
most conspicuous feature of the ﬁgures is the existence of two solutions in the interval m c < m < 0 where
m c = −0.0904286 . . .. One solution has positive slope and the other negative, indicating backﬂow in the
boundary layer. The slope vanishes at the critical point m = m c , where the positive solution joins with the
negative with vertical tangent.

Accelerating and decelerating slip-ﬂow
In the region 0 < m < ∞ the slip-velocity increases downstream. The solutions are unique and all resemble
the Blasius solutions, except that the thickness scale
δ(x) ∼ x (1−m)/2
√

(28.53)

grows slower than x. For m > 1 the layer is even suppressed by the accelerating ﬂow and gets thinner
with x.
√
For −1 < m < 0 the slip-ﬂow decelerates and the thickness grows faster than x. There are, as
mentioned, precisely two solutions in the interval m c < m < 0. Just below the critical point, in the interval
−1/3 < m < m c , there are no solutions at all, but for any m in the interval −1 < m < −1/3 there
appears to be from one to three distinct solutions with different values of the slope [64]. These solutions
oscillate and overshoot while converging upon f (∞) = 1. They are of no interest in the context of ﬂat
plate boundary layers.

Separation?
Self-similar ﬂows can strictly speaking not be used to model separation, because the velocity proﬁle by
construction has the same general shape for all x . If we let m slide down towards the critical value m c , it
nevertheless looks very much as if separation does take place (all over the x -axis at the same time). At the
critical point, where the positive solution joins with the backﬂowing negative solution, there is a singularity
with inﬁnite slope derivative f (m c ). Such singularities are generic for the Prantdl equations (see section
28.8).

∗ 28.7 Exact results for varying slip-ﬂow
A varying slip-ﬂow U (x) will strongly inﬂuence the ﬂow in the boundary layer. Accelerating ﬂow with
dU/d x > 0 tends to suppress the boundary layer, so that its downstream thickness grows slower than the
√
x of the Blasius layer. Sufﬁciently strong acceleration may even make the boundary layer become thinner
√
downstream. Conversely, if the slip-ﬂow decelerates, dU/d x < 0, the thickness will grow faster than x,
and sufﬁciently strong deceleration may lift the boundary layer off the plate and make it wander into the
mainstream as a separated boundary layer.
In this section we shall establish some relations that are valid for any exact solution to Prandtl’s
equations. These relations will be useful for the discussion of the separation phenomenon to be taken
up in section 28.8. Although we shall always think of a ﬂat plate boundary layer, the following discussion
is also valid for slowly curving walls, such as the much-studied ﬂow around a cylinder.

Exact wall derivatives
At the wall, y = 0, we know that both vx and v y must vanish, and that the derivative of the velocity at the
wall,
λ=

∂vx
∂ y y=0

(28.54)

is in general non-vanishing, except at a separation point, where it has to vanish. The wall vorticity is
ωz = −λ.

wall curvature,

velocity towards its terminal value, U . Conversely, if the slip-velocity decreases (dU/d x < 0), the wall
curvature will be positive and adversely affect the approach to terminal velocity. This forces an inﬂection
point into the velocity proﬁle and raises the need for including higher derivatives to secure the turn-over
towards the asymptotic slip-ﬂow. For constant slip-ﬂow, i.e. the Blasius case, we have dU/d x = 0, and the
wall curvature vanishes.
The higher order wall derivatives may be calculated by differentiating the Prandtl equation repeatedly
with respect to y. Differentiating once, we ﬁnd

Exact integral relations
We have already derived a relation (28.36) from momentum balance in uniform ﬂow. For general varying
slip-ﬂow we ﬁrst rewrite the Prandtl equation (28.21) in the form,

It states that the drag on any inﬁnitesimal interval of the plate equals the rate of momentum loss from the

This relation states that the rate of heat dissipation in any inﬁnitesimal slice equals the rate of loss of kinetic
energy from the ﬂuid. It is also possible to derive further relations for angular momentum balance and
thermal energy balance [79, 61].
The integrands in the momentum and energy balance equations, (28.59) and (28.61), may be interpreted
physically in terms of ﬂow properties. The expression U − vx is the volume ﬂux of ﬂuid displaced by the
plate, the expression ρ0 (U − vx )vx is the ﬂux of ‘lost momentum’ caused by the presence of the plate,
2
1/2ρ0 (U 2 − vx )vx is the ﬂux of ‘lost kinetic energy’, and η(∂vx /∂ y)2 is the density of heat dissipation.

28.8 Laminar boundary layer separation
When a separating boundary layer takes off into a decelerating mainstream, the character of the mainstream
ﬂow is profoundly changed, thereby actually invalidating the Prandtl approximation. Careful analysis has
revealed that this is a generic problem, to which the boundary layer equations respond by developing an
unphysical singularity at the point of separation. This so-called Goldstein singularity [64] prevents us in
general from using boundary layer theory to connect the regions before and after separation.
Although Prandtl’s boundary layer theory for this reason is useless for separation problems, the
existence of a singularity is nevertheless believed to be an indicator of boundary layer separation in the
general vicinity of the point where the singularity occurs. During the twentieth century the problem of
predicting the singular separation point for boundary layers around variously shaped objects has been of
great importance to ﬂuid mechanics, for fundamental as well as technological reasons. It has proven to be
a challenging problem, to say the least [61, 64]. A number of approximative schemes have been proposed

Schematic picture of how separation is thought to take place
in a decelerating ﬂow.
The
mainstream ﬂow is profoundly
changed by the separation both
upstream and downstream from
the separation point.

British mathematical physicist.
Worked on numerical solutions
to the steady-ﬂow laminar
boundary layer equations.

and tried out, and with suitable empirical input, they compare reasonably well with analytic or numeric
calculations [79].
The Goldstein singularity is unavoidable as long as we persist in the belief that we can employ Prandtl’s
equations and also specify the slip-ﬂow velocity as we wish. The price to pay for avoiding the singularity
is that the Prandtl equations must be replaced by the Navier–Stokes equations and that the mainstream ﬂow
cannot be fully speciﬁed in advance, but has to be allowed to be inﬂuenced by what happens deep inside the
boundary layer. Since separation originates in the innermost viscous ‘deck’ of the boundary layer, viscosity
thus takes a decisive part in selecting the presumed inviscid ﬂow at large, again emphasizing that inviscid
ﬂow solutions are not unique, and that inviscid ﬂow is indeed an ideal.
In the last half of the twentieth century, it has been conclusively demonstrated through theoretical
analysis and numerical simulation that the Navier–Stokes equations do not lead to any boundary layer
singularities and do in fact smoothly connect the regions before and after separation. The most successful
method is in fact a natural extension of Prandtl’s idea of dividing the ﬂow into two ‘decks’, a viscous
transition layer and an inviscid slip-ﬂow layer, that in the end are ‘stitched together’ to form a complete
boundary layer. In the ‘triple deck’ approach the transition layer is further subdivided into a nearwall viscous sublayer and a second viscous layer interpolating between the sublayer and the slip-ﬂow.
Unfortunately, there does not seem to be any simple way of presenting this modern ‘interactive’ boundary
layer theory [61, 64, 68].
In this section we shall ﬁrst justify that the Goldstein singularity exists, and make a primitive attempt to
determine its position in a number of cases where the exact position is known (table 28.1). In the remainder
of the section we shall see that it is possible to predict the position of the singularity to an accuracy better
than 1% from momentum and energy balance alone without any empirical input. A simpliﬁed version of
this model yields an accuracy better than 3%.

The wall-anchored model
The simplest model of boundary layer ﬂow is obtained by approximating the velocity proﬁle with a fourthorder polynomial in y constructed from the exact wall derivatives (page 423)

slip-ﬂow (U < 0), the second-order term is always positive, and the fourth-order term is always negative
just upstream from the separation point, because the slope λ is positive and decreasing towards zero at
separation. After an initial rise governed by the ﬁrst- and second-order terms, the fourth-order term must
eventually pull down the proﬁle to minus inﬁnity, unless we ‘catch’ it at the top.
We ‘catch’ the proﬁle by requiring the velocity to join smoothly at maximum with the given slip-ﬂow
U (x), i.e. vx = U (x) and ∂vx /∂ y = 0 at y = δ , resulting in the conditions,

of this model are listed in the third column (marked ‘wall’) in table 28.1 for nine decelerating slip-ﬂows.
They agree rather poorly with the exact results (second column), overshooting by up to 50%. The poor
performance of the model must be ascribed to the much too solid anchoring of the boundary layer to the
wall, which tends to generate errors in the shape of the velocity proﬁle in the bulk of the boundary layer.

This shows that there is in fact only one free parameter in the problem, say δ , satisfying a ﬁrst-order
differential equation (see problem 28.6). It also follows from this relation that since λ = 0 at a separation
point the thickness δc = δ(xc ) will be ﬁnite here,
δc = 2 −

The fourth-order polynomial
joins smoothly with vx = U with
a horizontal inﬂection point at

y = δ which diverges to +∞ for
µ < 3 is not used.

The wall-anchored approximation (28.66) suffers from an unnatural jump in the curvature ∂ 2 vx /∂ y 2 at the
edge of the boundary layer at y = δ . A smoother fourth-order polynomial was introduced by Pohlhausen
in 1921, in which the coefﬁcients are ﬁxed by demanding the ﬁeld to approach vx = U at y = δ with
vanishing ﬁrst- and second-order derivatives,

It contains two unknown functions: the dimensionless slope at the wall µ(x) and the layer thickness δ(x).
One may readily verify that this is indeed Ç ( y − δ)3 for y → δ .
Note that for µ < 2, the second- and fourth-order terms are always positive. It is the negative thirdorder term, which secures the smooth turn-over towards the slip-ﬂow at y = δ . A selection of this family
of proﬁles is shown in ﬁgure 28.10. The proﬁles are well deﬁned for all µ, both before the separation point
(µ > 0) and after (µ < 0). After separation they exhibit backﬂow, as one would expect, but the Goldstein
singularity prevents us from connecting these two regions of solutions.
Pohlhausen solved the model by imposing the wall-curvature condition (28.55) together with the von
Karman relation (28.63a). The details are given in problem 28.7, and the separation point predictions are
tabulated in the fourth column (marked ‘wall+mom’) of table 28.1. The agreement is still rather poor with
typical errors of 25%.

is the proﬁle at separation, corresponding to µ = 0, and the proﬁles with µ < 0 have backﬂow.
Inserting these into the integral relations (28.63), one arrives at two rather horrible coupled ﬁrst-order
differential equations for δ and µ. These differential equations are derived in problem 28.8 and solved
numerically with the results shown in the column marked ‘mom+ener’ of table 28.1. They agree with the
exact singularities to better than 1% in nearly all cases, demonstrating that together momentum and energy
balance do predict the position of the Goldstein singularity with acceptable precision.

Approximative solution
We now turn to the question of whether it is possible to simplify the model and still retain a reasonable
predictive ability. The approximation is based on the observation that the dimensionless ratios δmom /δener
and δener /δheat are nearly constant because the terms linear in µ cancel in the ratios (see also ﬁgure 28.11).
Multiplying the energy relation (28.63b) with 4U 3 δener , we may rewrite it as

Since the left-hand side depends only on the given velocity U (x), and the right-hand side is a known rational
function of µ(x) in the Pohlhausen model (see problem 28.9), this equation may be solved for µ(x). Having
obtained µ(x) one may then search for a separation point where µ(x) = 0. For the Blasius layer where
there is no separation point, the left-hand side vanishes and we obtain instead from the right-hand side
δheat δener = 2δwall δmom , a relation which we have already derived in (28.65).

Solving this equation for the usual test cases we ﬁnd the results shown in the last column of table 28.1.
The errors are typically less than 3% which is as good as the semi-empirical methods [79]. The model also
predicts µ(x) via (28.83) and thus all the thickness ratios (28.75) and (28.76). The absolute thickness scale
δ(x) is ﬁnally obtained from (28.80).

Separation from cylinder
Some of the more interesting slip-ﬂows ﬁrst accelerate and then decelerate. Among them the notorious
cylinder in a uniform cross-wind, which has been the favourite target for boundary layer research for nearly
a hundred years. The cylinder presents two difﬁculties, as does in fact every realistic separation problem.
The ﬁrst is the question of what is the correct slip-ﬂow. Since separation interacts with the mainstream ﬂow,
this is not so simple. The second is the technical question of calculating a precise value for the separation
point in a slip-ﬂow that may not be purely decelerating.

PROBLEMS

431

If the external ﬂow around the cylinder is taken to be the potential ﬂow, the slip-ﬂow is given by
(16.66b), i.e. U (x) = 2U0 sin x where U0 is the strength of the uniform cross-wind and x is the angle of
observation (the upwind direction corresponds to x = 0). The approximative equation (28.85) immediately
yields xc = 1.800 = 103 ◦ . The exact separation point for this slip-ﬂow (obtained by numerical calculation)
is known to be xc = 1.823 ≈ 104 ◦ (see [79]), so in this case the approximation works to a precision only
slightly worse than 1%.
The real ﬂow around the cylinder is, however, not potential ﬂow because of the vorticity induced into
the main ﬂow by the boundary layer, especially in the separation region and beyond. Hiemenz (1911)
determined experimentally that the slip-ﬂow at a Reynolds number Re = U0 a/ν = 9500 was well described
by the odd polynomial [79, p. 272],
U = U0 (1.814x − 0.271x 3 − 0.0471x 5 ).

(28.86)

Now the approximative equation (28.85) predicts separation at xc = 1.372 = 78.6 ◦ which is only about
2% away from the value xc = 80.5 ◦ measured by Himenz. Even if agreement is obtained, this is not very
impressive, because the slip-ﬂow itself has not been calculated from ﬁrst principles. Most of the information
about the separation from the cylinder lies in fact in the empirical slip-ﬂow.

The take off of a large airplane never fails to impress passengers and bystanders alike. After building up
speed during a brief half-minute run, gravity lets go and the plane marvellously lifts off. For this to happen,
it is obvious that the engines and the airﬂow must together generate a vertical force which is larger than
the weight of the aircraft. After becoming airborne the airplane accelerates further for a while, and then
goes into a fairly steep steady climb until it levels off at its cruising altitude. Aloft in level ﬂight at constant
speed, the aerodynamic lift must nearly balance the weight, whereas the engine thrust almost entirely goes
to oppose the drag. What is not obvious to most passengers is how the lift depends on the forward speed,
the angle of attack and the shape of the airframe, especially the wings.
The explanation of aerodynamic lift is in fact quite simple, even if it was only in the beginning of
the twentieth century—about the same time as the ﬁrst generation of airplanes were built—that the details
became understood. In nearly ideal ﬂow, pressure is the dominant stress acting on any surface, so to get lift
the pressure must on average be higher underneath the wing than above. Bernoulli’s theorem then implies
that the airspeed must be higher above the wing than below, effectively creating a circulation around the
wing, a kind of bound vortex superimposed on the general airﬂow. Without this circulation, caused by the
shape and ﬂying attitude of the wing, there can be no lift.
In this chapter we shall only study the most basic theory for subsonic ﬂight with an emphasis on
concepts and estimates. Aerodynamics is a huge subject (see for example [4, 23]) of importance for all
objects moving through the air, such as riﬂe bullets, rockets, airplanes, cars, birds and sailing ships, and
to some extent for submarines moving through water. The potential for triumphant rise and tragic fall
unavoidably associated with ﬂying machines makes aerodynamics different from most other branches of
science.

29.1 Aircraft controls
Historically aircraft design went through many phases with sometimes weird shapes emerging, especially
during the nineteenth century. In the twentieth century, where sustained powered ﬂight was ﬁnally attained,
most of the design problems were solved through systematic application of theory and experiment. The
history of the evolution of aerodynamics, the courageous men and their wonderful ﬂying machines, is
dramatic to say the least (see for example [3]).

Control surfaces
The majority of all winged aircraft that have ever been built are symmetric under reﬂection in a midplane.
The wings are typically placed in a plane orthogonal to the midplane, but often swept somewhat backwards
and a bit upwards. On the wings, and also on the horizontal and vertical stabilizing wing-like surfaces
found at the tail-end of most aircraft, there are smaller movable control surfaces, connected physically or

The three axes of a normal

rolls around the longitudinal axis,
pitches around the lateral axis,
and yaws around the directional

The nose lies at the
end of the longitudinal axis and
the wings in the plane of the

electronically to the ‘stick’ and the ‘pedals’ in the cockpit. Still smaller movable sections of the control
surfaces allow the pilot to trim the aircraft. When an aircraft is trimmed for steady ﬂight, the cockpit
controls are relaxed and do not require constant application of force to keep the airplane steady. At cruising
speed the aircraft is typically handled with quite small movements of the controls, often carried out by the
autopilot, whereas at low speeds, for example during take off and landing, much larger moves are necessary.

Main aircraft axes
The symmetry plane and the wing plane of normal aircraft deﬁne three orthogonal axes. The ﬁrst is the
longitudinal axis, running along the body of the aircraft in the intersection of the midplane and the wing
plane. Rotation around this axis is called roll, and is controlled by the ailerons usually found at the trailing
edge of the wings near the wing tips. When the pilot moves the stick from side to side the ailerons move
oppositely to each other and create a rolling moment around the longitudinal axis. The second is the lateral
axis which lies in the wing plane and is orthogonal to the midplane. Rotation around this axis is called pitch
and is normally controlled by the elevator, usually found in the tail of the aircraft. The pilot moves the
stick forward and backward to create a pitching moment around the lateral axis. The third is the directional
axis which is orthogonal to both the wings and the body, and thus vertical in straight level ﬂight. Rotation
around this axis is called yaw and normally controlled by the rudder, usually also placed in the tail end. In
conventional aircraft, the pilot presses foot pedals to move the rudder and create a yawing moment around
the directional axis. The Wright brothers were the ﬁrst to introduce controls for all three axes of their
aircraft [3, p. 243].

Take off, cruise and landing
The take off of a normal passenger aircraft begins with a run typically lasting half a minute. In modern
aircraft with a nose wheel, the body stays horizontal during the whole run, whereas in older aircraft with a
tail wheel or slider, the tail would lift up well into the run ﬁrst and then make the body nearly horizontal.
Having reached sufﬁcient speed for ﬂight, about 250–300 km h−1 for large passenger jet planes, the pilot
gently pulls the stick back and thereby raises the elevator, creating a pitching moment that lifts the nose
wheel off the runway while the main undercarriage stays in contact with it. After a bit of acceleration in this
attitude the undercarriage also leaves the runway, and the aircraft is airborne. For safety reasons the aircraft
should not lift-off until the speed is somewhat above the minimal speed for ﬂight. In older airplanes, the
actual lift-off was almost imperceptible, whereas the powerful engines of modern aircraft make the lift-off
much more notable through the rather steep climb angle that the aircraft is capable of assuming immediately
afterwards. The climb normally lasts until the aircraft has reached cruising altitude, typically 10 000 m, at
which point it levels off and accelerates further until it reaches cruising speed, around 800–900 km h−1 for
a modern jet. At normal temperature and pressure the sound speed is about 1200 km h−1 but at cruising
altitude the fall in temperature has reduced it by about 10%—as can be seen from equation (16.9). The
airspeed is thus about 85% of sound speed, also called Mach 0.85.
Landing is by far the hardest part of ﬂying. The aircraft has to be brought down to the ground and the
speed must be reduced. At low speed the aircraft controls need to be worked harder than at high speed, and
random winds and turbulence inﬂuence the aircraft much more. Keeping the air speed above stall speed
is uppermost in the pilot’s mind, because a stall at low altitude makes the airplane crash into the ground.
Landing speeds are comparable to take off speeds, but the aircraft has to be maneuvered into the narrow
space that the runway presents, and in all kinds of weather. Landing lengths can be made shorter than take
off lengths by diverting jet exhaust into the forward direction or reversing propeller blades, in addition to
the application of wheel brakes.
Example 29.1.1 (Boeing 747-200): Jet engines develop nearly constant thrust (force) at a given altitude
such that their power (energy output per unit of time) increases proportionally with airspeed, all other
factors being equal. Propeller engines yield instead roughly constant power so that the thrust decreases
inversely with airspeed. Ignoring air resistance (drag), the constant thrust from jet engines translates
into nearly constant acceleration during the take off run. A typical large passenger jet airliner (Boeing
747-200) has a maximal weight of 374 000 kg and four engines that together yield a maximum thrust of
973 000 N, corresponding to a runway acceleration of 2.6 m s−2 when fully loaded. At this acceleration
the plane reaches take off speed of 290 km h−1 in 31 s after a run of about 1250 m. Actual take off

length is somewhat larger because of drag and rolling friction. For safety reasons, runways are required
to be at least twice that length, typically between 3 and 4 km.

Extreme ﬂying
An aircraft can in principle move through the air in any attitude—and some pilots enjoy making their
planes do exactly that—but there is an intended normal ﬂying attitude with the wings nearly horizontal and
orthogonal to the airﬂow. In this attitude, the aircraft is designed such that the ﬂow of air over the wings and
body of the aircraft is as laminar as possible, because laminar ﬂow yields the largest lift force and smallest
drag.
In other attitudes, steep climb, dive, roll, loop, tight turn, spin, tail-glide, sideways crabbing etc, the
airﬂow over the wings may become turbulent resulting in almost complete loss of lift. When that happens,
the aircraft is said to have stalled. Stalling an aircraft in level ﬂight at sufﬁcient altitude is a common–and
fun–training exercise. First, the engine power is cut to make the aircraft slow down. While the airspeed
is falling the pilot slowly pulls back the stick to pitch the nose upwards so that the aircraft keeps constant
altitude. This can of course not continue, and at a critical point the laminar ﬂow over the wings is lost and
replaced by turbulence. The aircraft suddenly and seemingly by its own volition pitches its nose downwards
and begins to pick up speed in a dive. A modern aircraft normally recovers all by itself and goes into a steady
glide at a somewhat lower altitude. A stall close to the ground can be catastrophic, as the many hang-glider
accidents can conﬁrm (the ﬁrst fatal one happened in 1896 and cost the life of ﬂight pioneer Otto Lilienthal).
Most aircraft are today equipped with mechanical stall detection devices near the leading edge of the
wings, and audible stall warnings are frequently heard in aircraft cockpits during landing, just before
touchdown. The warnings indicate that a stall in the wing ﬂow is imminent, although the aircraft
will usually not go into a proper stall before touching down.
Other situations may arise in which only a part of the lifting surfaces stall. In a tight turn at low speed,
the inner wing may stall whereas the outer wing keeps ﬂying, and the aircraft goes into a vertical spin. In the
early days of ﬂight it was nearly impossible to recover from such a situation which could easily arise if the
aircraft was damaged, for example in air combat. In those days pilots were not equipped with parachutes,
and they often saw no other way out than jumping from the airplane, rather than burn with it. Today’s
passenger aircraft are not cleared for spin, but it can be fun to take a modern small aircraft that is cleared
for aerobatics into a spin at sufﬁcient altitude, for example by pulling hard back and sideways at the stick
just before it otherwise would go into a normal stall, as described above. Most people ﬁnd the experience
quite unpleasant and disorienting, especially due to the weightlessness that is felt while the aircraft slowly
tumbles over before it goes into a proper spin. Again, modern aircraft are so stable that they tend to slip out
of a spin by themselves if the controls are left free.

29.2 Aerodynamic forces and moments
There are several stages in the process of getting to understand ﬂight. The ﬁrst of these concerns the global
forces and moments that act on a moving body completely immersed in a nearly ideal ﬂuid such as air.
Initially we put no constraints on the shape of the object or on the motion of the air relative to the object,
although mostly we shall think of an aircraft under normal ﬂight conditions, and discuss only the forces
acting on it. Apart from scattered comments we leave the discussion of moments to more specialized
treatments [4].

Total force
The total force acting on a body determines the acceleration of its centre of mass. The only way a ﬂuid
can act on an immersed body is through contact forces, described by the stress tensor σ = {σi j }. Including
the weight M g 0 and engine thrust T the total force becomes,
= T + M g0 +

is the resultant of all contact forces acting on the body, also called the reaction force (chapter 23). In
principle this includes hydrostatic buoyancy forces (chapter 5), which serve to diminish the effective
gravitational mass of a body. For heavier-than-air ﬂying, buoyancy can normally be disregarded.

It is convenient to resolve the reaction force into two components, the lift which is orthogonal to the
instantaneous centre-of-mass velocity U of the aircraft, and the drag which is parallel with it,

Ê =Ä+

(29.3)

Lift and drag thus satisfy

Ä · U = 0,

× U = 0.

(29.4)

The drag always acts in the opposite direction of the centre-of-mass velocity whereas the lift may take any
direction orthogonal to it.
Lift may even point directly downwards. It is for this reason dangerous to ﬂy an aircraft inverted
close to the ground, because the gut reaction of pulling the stick towards you to get away from the
ground will generate an extra lift which sends you directly into the ground. During banked turns an
airplane also generates lift away from the vertical, creating in this way the centripetal force necessary
to change its direction.

The total moment of all forces acting on the body is

The total moment depends on the choice of origin for the coordinate system, but if the total force on the
body vanishes, the total moment becomes independent of the origin. In that case one may calculate the total
moment around any convenient point, for example the centre of gravity. The individual contributions to the
total moment will depend on the choice of origin, even if their sum is independent.

29.3 Steady ﬂight

The two situations above are
physically equivalent.
In the
upper drawing the centre-of-mass
moves with velocity U to the
left. In the lower, the centreof-mass does not move, but
the surrounding air moves with
velocity U to the right at great
distances from the object.

In steady ﬂight the aircraft moves with constant centre-of-mass velocity in a non-accelerated frame of
reference, so that the sum of all forces must vanish
T + M g0 +

Ä+

= 0.

(29.7)

Even if passenger comfort demands that the pilot tries to achieve nearly vanishing total force on an
airplane, irregular motion of the air may buffet the plane around. In extreme cases, unannounced clear air
turbulence may suddenly cause unfettered passengers to ﬂy around inside the cabin. We shall disregard such
phenomena and assume that the aircraft is capable of ﬂying with a steady velocity through an atmosphere
that would have been at rest were it not for the moving aircraft. Since forces in Newtonian mechanics are

29.3. STEADY FLIGHT

the same in all inertial reference frames, we are free to work in the rest-frame of the aircraft where the air
asymptotically moves at constant speed.
The orientation of an aircraft with respect to the direction of ﬂight (and the vertical) is called its ﬂying
attitude. The main attitude parameter responsible for lift is the angle of attack α, also called the angle of
incidence, between the airﬂow and the plane of the aircraft, formed by the longitudinal and lateral axes. In
normal ﬂight at high speed the angle of attack is usually quite small, typically a couple of degrees.
In the same way as ﬂoating bodies, ships and icebergs, should be in stable hydrostatic equilibrium,
aircraft should preferably also be dynamically stable in steady ﬂight, meaning that a small perturbation of
the aircraft’s steady ﬂying attitude should generate a moment counteracting the perturbation. In general this
requires the centre of thrust to lie forward of the aerodynamic centre.

¹U

.

The angle of attack α is the angle
between airﬂow U and the plane
of the aircraft.

Most modern aircraft are dynamically stable when properly trimmed, and that is very good
for amateur pilots, but in military ﬁghter planes, dynamic stability is sometimes traded for
maneuverability. Certain modern ﬁghter planes can in fact only maintain a stable attitude through
corrections continually applied to the control surfaces by a fast computer.

Steady climb
After acceleration and take off a powered aircraft normally goes into a steady climb forming a constant
positive climb angle (or angle of ascent) θ with the horizon. Cockpit instruments usually indicate the
vertical velocity, called the rate of ascent or climb rate U sin θ, rather than the climb angle. Having reached
cruising altitude the pilot reduces power to a fuel-economic setting and the aircraft levels off with θ = 0
and a tiny angle of attack consistent with steady ﬂight. In this phase of ﬂight lift must nearly balance weight
and thrust must nearly balance drag. Approaching its destination, the power is reduced, though usually not
cut completely off, and the aircraft goes into a powered descent with negative θ. Just before landing, power
is lowered to near zero, the aircraft ﬂares out almost horizontally with θ ≈ 0 and nose up under a fairly
large angle of attack before the ﬁnal touchdown.
Assuming that the thrust is directed along the longitudinal axis, as is normally the case for ﬁxed-wing
aircraft1 , we obtain the following expressions for lift and drag by projecting the equation of force balance
(29.7) on the direction of motion and the direction orthogonal to it,
= T cos α − Mg0 sin θ,

Ä = −T sin α + Mg0 cos θ.

(29.8)

Given the values of all the parameters on the right-hand sides, we may calculate the values of lift and drag
that are required to keep the aircraft in steady ﬂight.
This is, however, not really the way a pilot operates an aircraft. Typically, the pilot selects a power
setting for the engine(s) and a certain rate of climb, and then waits until the aircraft steadies on a
certain airspeed, angle of attack and angle of climb. This procedure, of course, presupposes that
there are such solutions within the aircraft’s ﬂight envelope for the speciﬁed values of power and
climb rate (if not, the aircraft will stall). We shall see later that aerodynamic theory allows us to
calculate lift and drag for a given aircraft in terms of the airspeed, the angle of attack and the air
density. The steady ﬂight equations (29.8) may then be solved for the airspeed U and the angle of
attack α, given the air density, the weight, the engine power, and the climb rate. There is the further
complication that for a given engine setting the thrust T tends to fall inversely with airspeed for
propeller engines whereas it stays more or less constant for jets. On top of that, the air temperature,
pressure and density all vary with altitude.
During steady climb with a small angle of attack, α

weight of the aircraft Mg0 determines the climb angle. To get a ﬁnite positive angle of climb, the thrust
1 In other types of aircraft the engine thrust can also have a component orthogonal to the longitudinal axis which also
contributes to lift. In the extreme case of a VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) aircraft, for example a helicopter, there
is almost no other lift, and the engine thrust balances by itself both drag and weight.

Unpowered steady descent
Most freely falling objects quickly reach a constant terminal velocity. Stones fall vertically, whereas aircraft,
paper gliders, paragliders and parachutists in free fall will attain sometimes large horizontal speeds. An
aircraft in unpowered ﬂight is able to glide towards the ground with constant velocity and constant rate of
descent. It is part of early training for pilots to learn how to handle their craft in unpowered steady descent,
and usually the aircraft is so dynamically stable that it by itself ends up in a steady glide if the engine power
is cut and the controls are left free. Paper gliders on the other hand often go through a series of swooping
dives broken by stalls, or spiral towards the ground in a spin.
During steady unpowered descent the air hits the aircraft from below at an angle γ with the horizontal,
called the glide angle, corresponding to a glide slope tan γ . The ratio of horizontal to vertical air speed is
called the glide ratio, and equals the inverse of the glide slope, i.e. cot γ . An aircraft can glide steadily with
different airspeeds for a large range of angles of attack. The angle of attack that yields maximal glide ratio
determines how far an aircraft at best can reach by gliding down from a given altitude h, also called its glide
range, x = h cot γ .
Typical commercial aircraft have best glide ratios of 10–20 with 17 for the Boeing 747 and 8 for
Concorde. So, if the engines cut out at an altitude of 10 km, the pilot has to look for a place to land
inside 100–200 km, depending on the aircraft. These glide ratios are comparable to those of gliding
birds like the swift with glide ratio 10 and soaring birds like the albatross with glide ratio 20. Modern
sailplanes may reach glide ratios around 30–55 and in extreme cases even higher. The space shuttle
with its stubbed wings and large weight is a rather bad glider, and approaches the runway at a glide
angle γ = 19 ◦ , corresponding to a glide ratio of around 3, comparable to that of a sparrow. The
human body is even worse, with a best glide ratio of about unity.
In steady unpowered descent the aerodynamic reaction force must be equal and opposite to the weight
of the aircraft, or in size Ê = Mg0 . Resolving the reaction force into lift and drag we ﬁnd,

Ä = Mg0 cos γ ,

These equations could also have been obtained from the steady ﬂight equations (29.8) with T = 0 and
θ = −γ . From the glide angle and the weight of an aircraft, we may thus determine both the lift and drag
that acts on it in this ﬂight condition. The glide ratio evidently equals the ratio of lift to drag in unpowered
descent,

(29.11)

Aerodynamics tells us (see the following section) that the ratio of lift to drag essentially only depends on
the angle of attack, so the best glide ratio is obtained by choosing that angle of attack which maximizes
Ä/ .
Note that neither lift nor drag are horizontal in unpowered descent. The lift is tilted forward and the
drag backwards.

Copyright © 2005 IOP Publishing Ltd.

The forward tilt of the lift also allows us to understand broadly how birds and insects generate thrust
in level ﬂight by ﬂapping their wings straight up and down. In this unsteady ﬂight mode there is no
instantaneous balance of aerodynamic forces and gravity, but during the downstroke the air will hit
the wing from below and generate a tilted lift, propelling the bird forward (and upwards), provided
the drag is not too large. During upstroke the picture is inverted, and air hits the wing from above,
but the lift is still tilted forwards and thus again propels the bird forwards, provided drag does not

overwhelm it. Insects and birds that hover instead of ﬂying horizontally get lift by interacting with
vortices created at the leading edge of the wings during the downstroke and by other mechanisms2 .

Horizontal banked turn
Consider an aircraft ﬂying steadily under power with velocity U in a horizontal circle of radius R. From the
(rotating) rest frame of the aircraft, the air again ﬂows steadily past with velocity U , but now there is also
a centrifugal force MU 2 /R directed away from the centre of the circle. The engine thrust is assumed to
balance the drag, and the lift must therefore balance the vector sum of the weight and the centrifugal force.
Denoting by β the angle between the vertical and the lift vector, and projecting the lift on the horizontal
as well as the vertical directions, we obtain the equations,

commercial aircraft rarely bank beyond 15◦ with a nearly imperceptible increase in load factor of about
4%. At a speed of about 900 km h−1 and β ≈ 15 ◦ , the clean turn diameter is 2R = 2U 2 cot β/g0 ≈
48 km, and a full turn at this speed takes 2π R/U ≈ 10 min.

29.4 Estimating lift
Aerodynamic lift in nearly ideal ﬂow is almost entirely caused by pressure differences between the upper
and lower wing surfaces. In this section we shall describe the basic physics of lift and estimate its properties
from relatively simple physical arguments, and in the following section we shall make similar estimates of
the various contributions to drag. It should, however, be borne in mind that we would rather want to
calculate lift and drag from ﬂuid mechanics, in terms of the angle of attack, velocity, air density and the
shape of the wing. Such theoretical knowledge makes it possible to predict which parameter intervals allow
an aircraft to become airborne and sustain steady ﬂight. In section 29.7 we explicitly calculate the lift for
thin airfoils.

Wing and airfoil geometry
An airplane wing may be characterized by three different length scales: the tip-to-tip length or span L, the
transverse width or chord c and the thickness d. A wing can only in the coarsest of approximations be
viewed as a rectangular box. Typical wings are both thin and long, d
c
L. Many wings taper towards
the tip and are swept back towards the rear. Other wing shapes are also found, for example the delta-wing
of supersonic aircraft such as Concorde. For a rectangular wing, the dimensionless number L/c is called
the aspect ratio. For tapering and unusually shaped wings where the true cord length may be ill-deﬁned,
one may instead use the average cord length c = A/L, where A is the planiform area of the wing (the area

of the wing’s ‘shadow’ on the wing plane), so that the aspect ratio becomes L/c = L 2 /A. The wing may
furthermore twist slightly along the span leading to a varying angle of attack. This is, in particular, true for
propellers that basically are wings mounted on a rotating shaft.
The transverse wing proﬁle, also called the airfoil, is normally slightly curved, or cambered, along the
cord, with a soft leading edge and a sharp trailing edge. The angle of attack of an airfoil is deﬁned to be the
angle between the asymptotic airﬂow and the chord line which is a straight line of length c connecting the
leading and trailing edges. Depending on how the wings are attached to the aircraft there may be a small
difference between the angles of attack of the wing and the aircraft.
Example 29.4.1: The Boeing 747-400 has a wing span of L ≈ 64 m and a wing area A ≈ 520 m2 ,
leading to an average cord length of c ≈ 8 m and an aspect ratio of L/c ≈ 8. For comparison, the
albatross with its narrow long wings has an aspect ratio of about 20, at par with modern sailplanes. At
the extreme end one ﬁnds NASAs solar-cell powered ﬂyer Helios which has an aspect ratio of nearly
31. Incidentally, a man with his arms stretched out as wings has an aspect ratio of about 20, so aspect
ratio is not everything.

Wing loading

chordwise Reynolds number,

Uc
,
ν

(29.15)

is a dimensionless combination of the asymptotic ﬂow speed U , the chord c and the kinematic viscosity of
air, ν = η/ρ which characterizes the airﬂow around the wing. It will always be assumed to be very large,
of the order of many millions, so that the slip-ﬂow pattern around the wings just outside the omnipresent

boundary layers may be taken to be very nearly ideal. In section 28.3 it was shown that the slip-ﬂow
pressure then penetrates the boundary layer and acts directly on the upper and lower wing surfaces.
In this situation the only way to obtain lift is by the slip-ﬂow pressure pa immediately above the wing
being generally lower than the slip-ﬂow pressure pb immediately below the wing (see ﬁgure 29.3). The
difference in average pressures above and below the wing may be estimated from the total lift per unit of

Example 29.4.2 (Cessna 150): The popular Cessna 150 two-seater has a wing span of L = 10.2 m,
wing area A = 14.8 m2 , and thus an average chord of c ≈ 1.45 m, and an aspect ratio of L/c ≈ 7.0.
With a maximum take off mass of M = 681 kg, the wing loading becomes Ä/ A ≈ 451 Pa which is
merely 0.45% of atmospheric pressure at sea level. Cruising with U = 180 km h−1 at sea level, the
Mach number is Ma ≈ 0.15 and the Reynolds number Rec ≈ 5 × 106 . The approximation of nearly
ideal ﬂow is very well fulﬁlled with boundary layers only millimetres thick.
Example 29.4.3 (Boeing 747-400): The cruising speed for the Boeing 747-400 is U ≈ 900 km h−1 ≈
250 m s−1 at the normal cruising altitude of z = 10 km. With an average chord length of c ≈ 8 m, the
chordwise Reynolds number becomes Rec ≈ 6 × 107 when we take ν ≈ 3.4 × 10−5 m2 s−1 at the
cruising altitude. The maximal take off mass is M ≈ 400 000 kg distributed over a wing area of about
A ≈ 520 m2 , leading to a wing loading of about Ä/ A ≈ 7500 Pa, which is only 7.5% of atmospheric
pressure at sea level, but about 25% of the actual pressure at the normal cruising altitude (see section
4.6).

Velocity differences
In nearly ideal ﬂow Bernoulli’s theorem may be used to relate the pressure and ﬂow velocity well outside
the boundary layers. As previously discussed (section 16.4 on page 213) air is effectively incompressible
at speeds much lower than the speed of sound c S , i.e. for small Mach number Ma = U/c S , say Ma 0.3.
The following analysis of lift in incompressible ﬂow with constant density ρ0 thus excludes passenger jets
cruising at Ma ≈ 0.8–0.9 but we shall return to this question towards the end of the section.

Visualisation II ed W. Merzkirch, Hemisphere, Washington, 1982, pp 399–403.
This is the famous Kutta–Joukowsky theorem from the beginning of the twentieth century. Here derived
from estimates, we shall see in section 29.6 (page 456) that in nearly ideal and nearly irrotational ﬂow this
relation is in fact exact when is replaced by the average circulation
along the wing.
The realization that lift and circulation are two sides of the same coin, was probably the single most
important insight into the mechanics of ﬂight. With this in hand, the road was opened for calculating the
lift produced by any speciﬁc airfoil for which the circulation could be evaluated in asymptotically uniform,
irrotational ideal ﬂow.

The horseshoe vortex system
In nearly ideal irrotational ﬂow, the circulation is the same around any curve encircling the wing, because
Stokes’ theorem relates the difference in circulation between two such curves to the ﬂux of vorticity (which
is assumed to vanish) through the surface bounded by the two curves. The lift-generating circulation thus
forms a bound vortex that ideally cannot leave the wing. For an inﬁnitely long wing this creates no problem,
but for a wing of ﬁnite span, the assumption of vanishing vorticity has to break down, because one of the
curves may be ‘slid over’ the tip of the wing and shrunk to a point with no circulation. The inescapable
conclusion is that since lift requires non-zero circulation, vorticity must come off somewhere along the
ﬁnite span of a real wing.
The shedding of vorticity from a wing of ﬁnite span depends strongly on its shape. A wing that tapers
towards the tip will shed vorticity everywhere along its trailing edge, though most near the tip. If the wing
is rectangular with constant chord, the vorticity will tend to appear very close to the tip. In any case, the
vorticity coming off the wing is blown backwards with respect to the direction of ﬂight, forming a trailing
vortex in continuation of the bound vortex. Alternatively one may see the trailing vortex as created by the
ﬂow around the tip seeking to equalize the higher pressure underneath the wing with the lower pressure
above. Together with the bound vortex the two trailing vortices coming off the wing tips form a horseshoeshaped vortex system accompanying all winged aircraft in ﬂight.

Lift coefﬁcient
A wing’s ability to produce lift is characterized by the dimensionless lift coefﬁcient,
CL =

Ä
(1/2)ρ0 U 2 A

.

The denominator is proportional to the momentum ﬂux ρ0 U · U A through an area A orthogonal to the
mainstream direction, and thus sets the scale for the total force that the incoming airstream can exert on this
area. The factor 1/2 in the denominator is conventional. Knowing the lift coefﬁcient, we can immediately
determine the average velocity difference (29.19) vab = 1/2C L U .
Being dimensionless, the lift coefﬁcient can only depend on dimensionless quantities, such as the angle
of attack α, the Reynolds number Rec = U c/ν, the aspect ratio L/c, and other dimensionless quantities
characterizing the shape of the wing. The mainly empirical studies of wing behaviour by scientists and
engineers in the last half of the nineteenth century, up to and including the Wright brothers, led to the
understanding that the angle of attack was the most important parameter in the lift coefﬁcient. The
dependence on the other dimensionless parameters was found to be weaker, in fact so weak that it was
mostly ignored before 1900.
The weak dependence of the lift coefﬁcient on the Reynolds number and wing shape parameters allows
us to conclude that the lift itself,

Ä = 1 ρ0 U 2 A C L ,
2

A

The momentum ﬂux through the
area A from the uniform ﬂow
with velocity U is the product of
the momentum density ρ0 U and
the volume ﬂux U A.

(29.22)

(29.23)

is directly proportional to the air density, the wing area and to the square of the velocity. At take off and
especially during approach to landing, where speeds are low, the pilot can increase the wing area by means
of ﬂaps. Since lift always nearly equals the constant weight of the aircraft, it follows from this expression
that the increase in area will be compensated by a decrease in required airspeed (for a ﬁxed angle of attack).
Fully extended ﬂaps also have a considerably larger angle of attack than the wing itself, increasing thereby
the lift coefﬁcient and leading to a further reduction in the required landing speed.

Empirically, the lift coefﬁcient is surprisingly linear in the angle of attack,

¹α

Sketch of a lift curve rising linearly until it veers off rather
sharply at an angle of typically
15–20 ◦ , signalling stall. Beyond this angle, lift drops precipitously, and so does the airplane.

(29.24)

where λ = dC L /dα is called the lift slope, and α0 is the angle of attack at which the lift vanishes. In section
29.7 we shall see theoretically that for thin airfoils the slope is universally λ = 2π (with the angle of attack
measured in radians). The zero-lift angle α0 depends mainly on the shape of the airfoil, and is usually small
and negative, for example α0 ≈ −2 ◦ for the Cessna 150 of example 29.4.2.
It follows from the above equations and the constancy of required lift (equal to the weight of the aircraft)
that the relative angle of attack α − α0 must vary inversely with the square of the velocity, α − α0 ∼ 1/U 2 .
With decreasing airspeed the required angle of attack rises rapidly until at some critical value boundary
layer separation no longer takes place at the trailing edge of the wing but instead suddenly moves forward
towards the leading edge, accompanied by turbulence over nearly all of the upper wing surface. The end
result is a dramatic loss of lift and a large increase in drag, a phenomenon called stall, which was described
on page 437.
Stall typically happens at a critical angle of attack, called the stall angle, of the order of αstall ≈ 15◦ –
20 ◦ for normal aircraft. Whereas the lift slope and zero-lift angle are essentially independent of the
Reynolds number in the linear regime, the stall angle increases a bit with the increasing Reynolds number.
For special aircraft the stall angle can be fairly high, for example 35 ◦ for delta-winged aircraft such as the
space-shuttle or Concorde. In such aircraft the higher stall angle is offset by a smaller lift slope, say λ ≈ 3
(per radian) rather than 2π. In order to get sufﬁcient lift, these aircraft are forced to take off and land under
remarkably high angles of attack.

Dependence on aspect ratio

which in the limit of the inﬁnite aspect ratio, L/c → ∞, converges upon 2π.
Example 29.4.4 (Cessna 150): For the Cessna 150 (page 443) at cruising speed U = 180 km h−1 we
have vab /U = 0.15, implying a lift coefﬁcient C L = 0.34. With aspect ratio L/c ≈ 7 the lift slope
is λ = 4.9, and the relative angle of attack becomes α − α0 = 4.0 ◦ . For this airfoil α0 = −2 ◦ , and the
true angle of attack becomes α = 2 ◦ . This airfoil has a stall angle of αstall = 16 ◦ , corresponding to a
stall velocity Ustall ≈ 80 km h−1 , although stall can be delayed somewhat by enlarging the wing area
by means of ﬂaps.

yielding small lift and large drag.

∗ Dependence on Mach number
Even if modern passenger jets ﬂy below the speed of sound, their Mach number Ma = U/c S is so close to
unity at cruising speed that there will be major corrections to the lift. To ﬁnd these corrections we go back
to the expression for the divergence of the velocity ﬁeld (16.33) on page 214 in compressible Euler ﬂow.

This shows that is a solution to the incompressible Laplace equation (16.61), provided the x-coordinate

Since lift stems from an integral of the pressure over x along the chord this rule immediately yields the
lift in subsonic compressible ﬂow,

Ä=

1 − Ma2

,

(29.28)

where Ä0 is the lift in incompressible ﬂow for Ma → 0. This Prandtl–Glauert rule is valid up to a critical
Mach number of about 0.7 where the ﬂow over part of the airfoil may become sonic [4, 3]. Applying it
nevertheless to the Boeing 747 of example 29.4.3 we ﬁnd Ä ≈ 2.2Ä0 at cruising speed, a quite sizeable
increase in lift which at a ﬁxed velocity can be offset by diminishing the angle of attack.

29.5 Estimating drag
Whereas lift has one cause, namely the pressure difference between the upper and lower wing surfaces,
drag has several. First, there is skin friction from the air ﬂowing over the wing. Second, there is form drag
due to the wing obstructing the free air ﬂow and leaving a trail of turbulent air behind, and third there is
induced drag from the vortices that always trail the wing tips. For real aircraft, the body shape and various
protrusions (radio antenna, Pitot tube, rivet heads, etc) also add to drag.
As for lift, it is convenient and customary to discuss drag in terms of the dimensionless drag coefﬁcient
CD =

(1/2)ρ0 U 2 A

which has the same denominator as the lift coefﬁcient (29.22).

The denominator can be understood in the following way. At the leading edge of a wing there is
always a streamline that ends with vanishing airspeed (stagnation). The pressure increase at the
stagnation point relative to inﬁnity is p = (1/2)ρ0 U 2 , according to Bernoulli’s theorem. If the
wing were raised squarely into the oncoming airﬂow, it would present an area A to this pressure,
and assuming that the turbulent ‘dead’ air behind the wing exerts essentially no extra pressure on the
back of the wing, the total drag force would be p A = (1/2)ρ0 U 2 A , which is the denominator.
If this argument is right, we predict C D ≈ 1 for a thin ﬂat plate with its face into the wind, and
that agrees in fact quite reasonably with both theory and experiment. For a circular disc we have
C D = 1.17 (see section 19.4 on page 275).

drag coefﬁcient rises steeply.

Skin friction
Close to the wing surfaces there are thin boundary layers (see chapter 28 on page 407), in which the ﬂow
velocity changes rapidly from zero right at the skin of the wing to the mainstream airspeed just outside. The
maximal thickness of the boundary layer on a wing may be estimated from the ﬂat plate laminar Blasius
solution (28.28) or from semi-empirical turbulent expression (28.41),

Boundary layers do not have the same thickness over the wing surface, but are generally thinnest at the
leading edge of the wing and become thicker towards the rear. Usually, the Reynolds number is so high that
the boundary layers also develop turbulence somewhere downstream from the leading edge. For aircraft
with chordwise Reynolds numbers in the millions and chords of the order of metres, a fully laminar
boundary layer is only millimetres thick whereas a fully turbulent layer is an order of magnitude thicker.
To estimate the skin friction we again use ﬂat-plate Blasius’ result (28.32) in the laminar regime and

The skin drag coefﬁcient always decreases with increasing Reynolds number, but like the thickness it varies
much more slowly in the turbulent region than in the laminar. Turbulent drag is considerably larger than
laminar drag, but precise theoretical prediction of skin drag is quite hard because it is difﬁcult to predict the
line along the span where the boundary layer becomes turbulent. This is one of the reasons why wind tunnel
experiments, and in more recent times numeric (CFD) simulations, have been and still are so important for
aerodynamics engineering.
Example 29.5.1 (Cessna 150): For the Cessna 150 of example 29.4.2 at cruising speed with Rec ≈
5 × 106 , the estimate of the maximal laminar boundary layer thickness becomes δ ≈ 3.4 mm whereas
the estimate of the maximal turbulent thickness becomes δ ≈ 26 mm. The corresponding laminar skin
drag coefﬁcient is C skin ≈ 0.0012 whereas the turbulent one is about six times larger, C skin ≈ 0.0070.
D
D
The true skin drag is probably closest to this value.

Form drag
The ﬂow around a highly streamlined body, such as a thin wing narrowing down into a sharp trailing edge,
will be nearly ideal everywhere, except in the boundary layers. It has been pointed out before (and we shall
prove it in the following section) that a body in a truly ideal, irrotational ﬂow does not experience any drag
at all, independent of its shape. Both skin friction and form drag therefore owe their existence to viscosity,
but where skin friction is due to shear stresses in the boundary layer, form drag arises from changes in the
pressure distribution over the body caused by the presence of boundary layers.
Airfoil boundary layers tend to become turbulent at some point downstream from the leading edge of
the wing. At the sharp trailing edge the boundary layers separate from the wing and continue as a trailing
wake (see ﬁgures 29.6 and 29.7). The unsteady turbulent wake found immediately behind the trailing edge
of a wing expands slowly and eventually calms down and becomes steady and laminar at some downstream
distance from the wing. Further downstream the laminar wake continues to expand by viscous diffusion at
a considerably faster rate than the turbulent wake. In section 29.8 we shall determine the general form of
the ﬁeld in the distant laminar wake.
Inside the trailing wake immediately behind the body, the pressure will be lower than the stagnation
pressure p = 1/2ρ0 U 2 at the leading edge (see ﬁgure 29.3), and this pressure difference is the cause of
drag. The thickness of the turbulent wake immediately after the trailing edge of the wing may be estimated
from the boundary layer thickness δ, leading to the form drag estimate form ∼ pLδ. In terms of the
drag coefﬁcient we thus ﬁnd for the turbulent case,
C form ∼
D

δ
−1/7
.
∼ Rec
c

(29.32)

Form drag usually amounts to a ﬁnite fraction of skin friction for streamlined objects where the boundary
layers are thin everywhere.
With growing angle of attack, ﬂow separation may occur on the upper side of the wing at some point
before the trailing edge of the airfoil, thereby increasing form drag and diminishing lift. At a certain angle
of attack, the point of separation for the turbulent boundary layer on the top side of the wing may suddenly
shift forward from the trailing edge, creating a highly turbulent region above the wing. This leads to loss of
almost all of the lift and at the same time an increased drag. The wing and the aircraft are then said to have
stalled.
The efforts of aircraft designers between the world wars in the twentieth century were mainly directed
towards form drag reduction by streamlining. A smaller drag generally implies higher top speed, greater
payload capacity and better fuel economy. Besides streamlining of lift surfaces, drag reduction was also
accomplished by internalizing the wing support structure and the undercarriage, and providing the engines
with carefully designed cowlings.

Figure 29.6. Horizontal velocity distribution (vx ) around an airfoil at Reynolds number Rec = 10 000 and
α ≈ 1 ◦ , obtained by numeric simulation. Note the faster ﬂow above the wing (light), the stagnating ﬂow at
the leading edge (dark), and the strong slowdown of the ﬂow in the boundary layers and the trailing wake
(very dark). The boundary layers are thin and laminar and thicken towards the rear especially on the upper
surface where the initial acceleration of the air is followed by deceleration. There is no turbulence in the
boundary layers at a Reynolds number as low as this. At more realistic Reynolds numbers in the millions,
the boundary layers are mostly turbulent and about an order of magnitude thinner than here. Well behind
the airfoil the wake has a thickness comparable to the boundary layers. The slow viscous expansion of the
laminar wake is not visible at the scale of this ﬁgure.

Induced drag
The two vortices trailing from the wing tips of an aircraft rotate in opposite directions and carry roughly the
same circulation as the vortex bound to the wing. They are created at a rate determined by the speed U
of the airplane and persist indeﬁnitely in a truly ideal ﬂuid. In a viscous ﬂuid they spin down and dissolve
after a certain time.
The process of ‘spinning up’ and ‘feeding out’ the trailing vortices from the wing-tips of the aircraft is
accompanied by a continuous loss of energy, which causes an extra drag on the aircraft. We can estimate the
order of magnitude of this drag from the kinetic energy contained in the core of a vortex with circulation
and core radius a. Since the maximal ﬂow speed is of order vφ ∼ /2πa, the kinetic energy of two
2
vortex segments of length x becomes of magnitude Ì ∼ ρ0 vφ πa 2 x ∼ ρ0 2 x (dropping all simple
numeric factors). This loss of energy must cause a drag on the aircraft of magnitude

Classical wing theory (for example [4, p. 369]) yields an expression of precisely this form but roughly a
factor π smaller. Since induced drag is a byproduct of the lift-generating ﬂow around a ﬁnite wing, it is
also called drag due to lift. It is the unavoidable price we have to pay for wings of ﬁnite span.
Induced drag is normally smaller than skin drag, but grows rapidly with increased angle of attack and
may win over skin drag at low speeds. This happens, for example, at take off and landing where the angle of
attack is large and the skin friction small. Most importantly, induced drag decreases with increasing aspect
ratio L/c, explaining why large aspect ratios are preferable, up to the point where the sheer length of the
wing begins to compromise the strength of the wing structure.

451

Example 29.5.2 (Cessna 150): For the Cessna 150 of example 29.5.1 cruising in level ﬂight with
C L ≈ 0.3 and aspect ratio 7 we ﬁnd Cinduced = 0.004 (including the factor 1/π). The induced drag
is thus about half of the turbulent skin drag. At half this speed the relative angle of attack is four times
bigger, so that the induced drag coefﬁcient becomes 16 times bigger whereas the turbulent skin drag
coefﬁcient stays roughly constant.

Ä/

Lift-to-drag ratio
The total drag coefﬁcient C D is the sum of all the contributions from various sources: skin drag, form drag,
induced drag, etc. The lift-to-drag ratio, in French called the ﬁnesse,

Ä

CD

(29.34)

is a measure of the aerodynamic efﬁciency of an airplane. Like lift and drag, the lift-to-drag ratio is strongly
dependent on the angle of attack and less on the Reynolds number and aspect ratio. The quadratic growth
of induced drag as a function of angle of attack normally overcomes the linear rise in lift and creates a
maximum in Ä/D for a certain angle of attack, typically at about half the stall angle. In view of the
difﬁculty in making theoretical estimates of drag on the airframe, empirical lift-to-drag curves are usually
provided for a particular aircraft to document its performance.

Sketch of a typical lift-to-drag
curve for an airplane.
The
maximal value of lift to drag
determines the best glide ratio
and the best glide speed.

Example 29.5.3 (Cessna 150): For the Cessna 150 the quoted maximal lift-to-drag ratio is 8.4 at
a speed Uglide ≈ 110 km h−1 . According to (29.11) the corresponding best glide angle is about
γ ≈ 6.8 ◦ . From the known lift Ä ≈ Mg0 cos γ it then follows that the lift coefﬁcient is C L ≈ 0.78,
and using the known lift slope λ = 4.9, the angle of attack becomes α ≈ 7.2 ◦ , making the aircraft
nearly horizontal in the glide. Cruising in level ﬂight with U = 180 km h−1 , the lift coefﬁcient is
instead C L ≈ 0.34, and the lift-to-drag ratio is reduced to about 4.5.

∗ Breguet’s range equation
Given an amount of fuel, the endurance and range of an aircraft depend on the aerodynamic efﬁciency of the
airframe and the engine efﬁciency. The latter is usually measured by the speciﬁc fuel consumption, deﬁned
as the rate of fuel consumption (by weight) per unit of produced thrust T ,

where M is the mass of the aircraft. We shall assume that f , which has dimension of inverse time, is a
constant characterizing the engine performance, independent of the thrust it delivers.

Since Ä ≈ Mg0 and
T = Mg0 /(Ä/D), and inserting this expression, we ﬁnd
f =−

(29.36)
M dt
As the fuel is spent, the mass of the aircraft decreases and with it the required lift. If the angle of attack is
kept constant, the velocity has to decrease, but the lift-to-drag ratio will be constant. Integrating the above
equation from t = 0, where the fuel tank is full and the mass of the aircraft is M0 , to time t, where the tank
is empty and the mass is M0 − M, we obtain the aircraft’s endurance, i.e. the length of time it can ﬂy on
a given amount of fuel,

The gentle growth of the logarithm shows that the endurance is not increased signiﬁcantly even if the fuel

In deriving this equation we have assumed constancy of U Ä/ as the fuel is being spent, such that U and
Ä/ may be taken to be the initial values for the fully loaded aircraft.
Example 29.5.4 (Cessna 150): The Cessna 150 has a usable fuel capacity of M = 61 kg and maximal
mass of M = 681 kg. Cruising at U = 180 km h−1 the fully loaded aircraft uses fuel at a rate of about
16 kg h−1 . Taking Ä/ ≈ 5, the total thrust is T ≈ Mg0 /(Ä/ ) ≈ 1300 N, and the speciﬁc fuel
consumption becomes f ≈ 3.2 × 10−5 s−1 . The predicted endurance becomes t ≈ 4 h and the range
x ≈ 720 km, in decent agreement with known values.

We have previously derived the Prandtl–Glauert rule (29.28) for the dependence of the lift on the Mach
number. That result was based on the assumption of ideal ﬂow and does not apply to skin and form drag
which as we have discussed is always caused by viscosity.
Empirically, the drag coefﬁcient is constant up to the critical Mach number Mac ≈ 0.7 where part of the
ﬂow over the wing becomes sonic. After this point the drag begins to increase rapidly with increasing speed.
At the time of the Second World War and just after, aircraft came close to the speed of sound and became
exposed to the violent stresses that reign here, stresses that could lead to breakup in the air. Although
common sense told the engineers that the drag could not actually diverge when the aircraft reached sound
speed, it was not clear whether it could mount to such high values that sound velocity would become a
barrier, in practice impenetrable with the engines and airframes available at that time. History of course
tells us that the ‘sound barrier’ was passed on October 14, 1947 with a rocket-propelled experimental
aircraft (see [4] for more details).

to act on arbitrarily chosen points

An often recurring question that can lead to heated discussions is whether an airplane stays aloft in steady
ﬂight because of the pressure differences between the upper and lower wing surfaces, or whether it gets
lift from diverting momentum downwards. The general treatment of momentum balance in section 22.5 on
page 311 indicates that the total contact force on the airplane should be balanced by an opposite momentum
ﬂux at great distances, where all stresses have died away. Either position is in fact tenable in a discussion,
but as we shall see the correct answer is more subtle than might be guessed at ﬁrst glance.

Momentum balance in a box
Let the steadily moving body—an aircraft or wing—be surrounded with a huge imagined ‘box’ of any
shape S, and let the volume of air between the body surface and the box be our control volume. As can be
seen from ﬁgure 29.7 this box will cut through the trailing wake somewhere behind the body. Disregarding
gravity, the total force acting on the control volume of air consists of the contact forces on the two bounding
surfaces,

where is the air’s reaction force (29.2) on the body. For the moment we do not split up the reaction force
into lift and drag.
In steady ﬂow the total momentum of the air contained in the control volume remains constant,
d /dt = 0, apart from small time-dependent contributions from the ﬂuctuating velocity ﬁeld in the
turbulent wake (which we shall ignore here). Since there can be no momentum ﬂux through the
impermeable surface of the body, it follows from momentum balance (23.2) that the total force on the

air in the control volume must equal the ﬂux of momentum out of the box
the reaction force and assuming for simplicity that the air is effectively incompressible, ρ = ρ0 , we ﬁnd,

Figure 29.7. Sketch of a body (airfoil) and its trailing wake. Initially the trailing wake is turbulent, but
expands slowly and becomes laminar some distance downstream. The thickness of the wake is greatly
exaggerated compared to the distance from the body. The dashed box surrounding the system (but crossing
through the trailing wake) is used in the text to deﬁne a control volume of air between the surfaces of the
body and the box.
where σ = {σi j } is the incompressible stress tensor σi j = − pδi j +η(∇i v j +∇ j vi ). The following analysis
can also be carried through for barotropic compressible air (problem 29.5).
The total reaction force on the body can thus be calculated from the pressure and velocity ﬁelds, all
evaluated at the surface of any box surrounding the body. It must be emphasized that this result is exact,
valid for any shape and size of body and box.

Box at spatial inﬁnity
Now let the box expand to huge distances in all directions such that the velocity ﬁeld on its surface
approaches the asymptotic value, v → U . Setting v = U + v in the ﬁrst (momentum) term of (29.40), it
becomes to ﬁrst order in v ,
−ρ0

S

(UU + U v +

v U) · d S.

Given that the total vector area of a closed surface always vanishes, d S = 0, together with global mass
conservation,
v · d S = 0, the ﬁrst two terms in the integrand do not contribute to the integral.
If we think of the ‘box’ as a huge sphere with radius r and surface area 4πr 2 , the velocity ﬁeld
correction must decay like | v| ∼ 1/r 2 at great distances outside the trailing wake for any contribution
to survive in the limit. Inside the wake the velocity ﬁeld behaves differently (see section 29.8) but the
general conclusions remain valid. The velocity derivatives in the stress tensor must consequently vanish
like |∇ v| ∼ 1/r 3 , and cannot contribute to the second term in (29.40). Pressure is thus the only stress
component that has a possibility of surviving in this limit, and the reaction force on the body may be written,

Ê = −ρ0

S

v U · dS −

p d S.

(29.41)

S

Since a constant pressure yields no contribution, we have replaced the pressure by the residual pressure
p = p − p0 where p0 is the constant asymptotic pressure. The residual pressure can only contribute to
the integral if it decays as p ∼ 1/r 2 outside the trailing wake, which we shall see that it does.
We are now in a position to answer the question of whether there remains a pressure contribution to
lift far from the moving body. Although the derivation of the above equation shows that the sum of the
momentum ﬂow and pressure contributions is independent of the choice of the box shape, each term by
itself may (and will) depend on it. The limiting value of the pressure contribution may depend on how the
box is taken to inﬁnity.

L
Box in the shape of a cylinder
of radius R and length L with
axis parallel to the asymptotic
velocity U.

If, for example, we choose a cube or sphere and let it expand uniformly in all directions, there will
usually be a residual pressure contribution to lift, even in the limit of an inﬁnite box (see section 29.8 for an
explicit calculation). Alternatively, one may choose a box in the form of a huge cylinder with radius R and
length L, oriented with its axis parallel to the asymptotic ﬂow U. The pressure integral over the end caps
cannot contribute to lift, because they are orthogonal to the velocity. If we now let the radius R become
inﬁnite, before the end caps are moved off to inﬁnity, the pressure integral over the cylinder surface will
behave like the area 2π L R times the pressure p ∼ 1/R 2 . It thus vanishes like L/R for R → ∞, leaving
no pressure contribution to lift in the limit (see [38]).

The contributions to the second term in (29.42) can only come from the region W , where the box cuts
through the wake. Choosing W to be planar and orthogonal to U, its surface element d S will be parallel
with U, and the second term becomes a pure drag,

formulae for lift and drag become slightly different (problem 29.6). Otherwise they are valid for all kinds
of bodies moving steadily through an incompressible ﬂuid at subsonic speed.

d’Alembert’s paradox: a gift to powered ﬂight
We have previously (page 226) shown that a cylinder or sphere in irrotational (potential) ﬂow experiences
no drag. In irrotational ﬂow, Bernoulli’s theorem is fulﬁlled everywhere, such that the drag (29.45) must
vanish. D’Alembert’s paradox must therefore be valid in full generality: there is no drag on a body of
arbitrary shape in completely irrotational ﬂow. But bodies moving through viscous ﬂuid cannot help
leaving a narrow trailing wake containing vorticity, and equation (29.45) immediately resolves the paradox:
the drag on a body stems entirely from the trailing wake.
In general, the narrower the wake the smaller the drag will be. As we have seen in the estimates of the
preceding section, drag is typically an order of magnitude smaller than lift for properly streamlined bodies,
such as airfoils. This indicates that one should rather treat d’Alembert’s ‘paradox’ as a theorem about the
near vanishing of drag for streamlined bodies at high Reynolds number. This theorem is in fact what makes
ﬂying technically possible with engines producing a thrust much smaller than the weight of the aircraft.
Without d’Alembert’s theorem, the Wright brothers would never have had a chance of ﬂying at Kitty Hawk
in December 1903, given the puny engine power then available to them.

Lift and vorticity
The box S used in the lift integral (29.43) is assumed to be of essentially inﬁnite size. Now let S be another
closed surface surrounding the body somewhere inside the box S. From Gauss’ theorem we obtain

S

U × (v × d S) = −

S

V

U × (∇ × v) d V = −

V

U × ω d V,

where V is the region between the two surfaces, and ω = ∇ × v is the vorticity ﬁeld. In the extreme case we
may take S to be the body surface itself, where the velocity and thus the integral over S vanishes because
of the no-slip condition. It then follows from the above equation that the lift (29.43) is also given by the
integral of the vorticity ﬁeld over all of the air space,

Ä = ρ0 U ×

air

ω d V.

(29.46)

This integral can only receive contributions from the regions of non-vanishing vorticity, i.e. from the
boundary layers and the trailing wake. Again we conclude that without vorticity created by friction, there
can be no lift!
More generally, if there is no vorticity found in V , the integral over the box S equals the integral over
S . The original box may in other words be deformed into any other closed surface as long as it crosses
no region containing vorticity. The box at inﬁnity has now served its purpose and may be forgotten. In the
following the surface S in (29.43) may be taken to be simply any surface surrounding the body, as long as
there is no vorticity outside S.

Lift and circulation
It is useful to introduce a ‘natural’ coordinate system with the x-axis along the direction of the asymptotic
velocity U = U e x and the y-axis along the lift = Äe y . Working out the cross products, the lift (29.43)
becomes

expressing that there should be no lift along the z-direction. For a symmetric aircraft in normal horizontal
ﬂight, this condition is automatically fulﬁlled.
The closed surface S may always be sliced into a set of planar closed contours C(z) parallel with the x yplane, and parametrized by the z-coordinate in some interval z 1 ≤ z ≤ z 2 . The contours are given negative
orientation in the x y-plane, i.e. clockwise as seen from positive z-values. Let now d = (d x, d y, 0) be a line
element on a point of the curve C(z); it is evidently a tangent vector to the surface S. Let d s = (0, d y, dz)
be another tangent vector to the surface in the yz-plane with the same y-coordinate d y. Then the outward
pointing surface element becomes d S = d s × d = (−d ydz, dzd x, −d xd y) and thus
vx d S y − v y d Sx = (vx d x + v y d y) dz = v · d dz.

29. SUBSONIC FLIGHT
If the contour is deformed, Stokes’ theorem (16.57) tells us that the circulation is unchanged provided the
contour is swept through an area A devoid of vorticity. Since we have assumed that vorticity is only found
in the boundary layers and the trailing wake, the contour may be freely deformed, as long as the piece of
the contour that crosses the wake is kept ﬁxed, and the new contour does not pass through the wake or into
the boundary layers. This is of course the same conclusion as was reached in the preceding subsection.
Again it should be emphasized that no approximations have been made, and that this result is exactly
valid, as long as the wake-crossing takes place at great distance from the body along a line parallel with the
y-axis.

1902 and many others early in

used the relation between lift and
circulation in 1906

The lift integral (29.49) may be written in the form of a generalized version of the Kutta–Joukowsky theorem
(29.21),

Ä = ρ0 U L

(29.51)

where
=

(29.52)

is the circulation along z averaged over the wing span L = z 2 −z 1 . The only difference is that the integration
contour C(z) used to calculate (z) in (29.50) has to cross the wake far away from the airfoil, whereas in
the original Kutta–Joukowsky theorem it is supposed to hug the airfoil tightly all the way around. We shall
now see how to get rid of the ‘tail’ of the contour when the chordwise Reynolds number, Rec = U c/ν and
the aspect ratio L/c are very large.
In this limit the ﬂow around the wing becomes nearly ideal and irrotational, and the √
boundary layers turn
into a ‘skin’ of vorticity covering the airfoil with nearly vanishing thickness δ ∼ c/ Rec . Downstream
from the airfoil, the skin continues into the trailing wake which forms a horizontal sheet, also of nearly
vanishing thickness δ. Physically, the ﬂow velocity in the wake cannot become inﬁnite, so that the
downstream volume ﬂux in the wake, which per unit of span is of order vx δ, must itself vanish in the
limit of inﬁnite Reynolds number. It then follows from mass conservation that the orthogonal velocity v y
must be the same above and below the sheet, for otherwise ﬂuid would accumulate in the wake.
The pressure must also be the same above and below the trailing wake sheet because of Newton’s third
2

law. Combining these two results with Bernoulli’s theorem, which states that p + 1/2ρ0 (vx + v 2 + vz )
y

span, especially the wing-tip vortices. When the aspect ratio is large, this ﬂow will be tiny compared

to the downstream ﬂow, i.e. |vz | ∼ vx c/L
Consequently, vx itself takes the same value just above and below the trailing sheet. The two oppositely
directed contributions to the integral (29.50) running along the tail of C thus tend to cancel each other for
large Reynolds number and aspect ratio.
Since the orthogonal velocity v y may not be inﬁnite inside the wake, the part of the integral from the
contour passing through the sheet will be of order of magnitude v y δ and thus vanish in the limit. The
contribution from the tail of the integration contour can thus be ignored in the leading approximation and
we may let it circle the wing while tightly hugging the airfoil proﬁle. Finally, we have arrived at the
(generalized) Kutta–Joukowsky theorem.

∗ 29.7 Two-dimensional airfoil theory
Most wings have fairly large aspect ratios in the vicinity of L/c ≈ 7–20 with airfoil cross sections that taper
gently towards the wing tips. For nearly inﬁnite aspect ratio and nearly constant cross section, there is very
little induced ﬂow along z towards the wing tips, so that the ﬂow becomes essentially two-dimensional,
v = (vx (x, y), v y (x, y), 0).

(29.53)

For such an airfoil, the circulation will be independent of z. Although it would be possible to simplify
the following calculations using complex notation as in section 26.3, we shall use the physically more
transparent real notation.

Figure 29.8. The irrotational velocity ﬁeld of the wing is viewed as a superposition of elementary line
vortices with singular cores arranged around the outline A of the airfoil. On the top of the airfoil, the
vortices tend to increase the local velocity above the asymptotic ﬂow U, and conversely at the bottom. The
airfoil is positioned with the chord-line on the x-axis and the y-axis at the leading edge. Its geometry is
described by two functions y± (x) with 0 ≤ x ≤ c where c is the chord length. The asymptotic ﬂow is
U = U (cos α, sin α), where α is the angle of attack. The trailing wake, indicated by the dashed line, also
forms an angle α with the x-axis. The z-axis comes out of the plane.

The ﬁeld of the vortex sheet
In the limit of nearly inﬁnite Reynolds number, vorticity only exists in the inﬁnitesimally thin boundary
skins of the airfoil. Outside these skins and outside the inﬁnitesimal sheet of the trailing wake, we assume
that the ﬂow is irrotational, described by a velocity potential that satisﬁes Laplace’s equation ∇ 2 = 0.
Being a linear equation, its solutions may be superposed. All the nonlinearity of the original Euler equation
has been collected in the Bernoulli pressure p = 1/2ρ0 (U 2 − v 2 ). The additivity of potential ﬂows makes
it possible to view the irrotational ﬂow outside the boundary layers as arising from a superposition of the
asymptotic ﬂow U and the ﬁeld generated by the sheet of vorticity covering the wing surface.
Due to the two-dimensional nature of the ﬂow, the vortex sheet making up the skin may be understood
as a collection of elementary line vortex cores running parallel with the z-axis (see ﬁgure 29.8). The
contribution from the velocity ﬁeld of a line vortex passing through the origin of the coordinate system with
the core parallel with the z-axis is of the well-known form (26.12),
v=

where is its circulation.
Denoting the inﬁnitesimal strength of the vortex passing through the point (x , y ) on the airfoil outline

Outside the singular core of a
line vortex the ﬂow is irrotational
with circular streamlines. The
ﬁeld around any collection of line
vortices is obtained by adding
their individual ﬁelds together.

(29.55)

Mathematically, the points of the airfoil outline should be parametrized as a pair of functions, (x, y) =
( f x (θ), f y (θ)), of a running parameter θ in some interval, say θ1 ≤ θ ≤ θ2 , beginning and ending at the
cusp. The circulation element then becomes d = γ (θ) dθ where γ (θ) is the circulation density. Wherever
possible we shall suppress this elaborate, but mathematically more concise, notation.

The Kutta condition
Near the front and rear ends of the airfoil there are stagnation points where the velocity ﬁeld vanishes. In
ideal ﬂow there may be more than one velocity ﬁeld solution satisfying the Euler equation (16.1) and the
boundary conditions. Such solutions may have different stagnation points and thus different circulation.
It is even possible to ﬁnd a solution with vanishing circulation (and lift). We shall see below that if the
rear stagnation point is not situated right at the cusp of the trailing edge, unacceptable inﬁnite velocity

Such a ﬂow may have vanishing

ﬁeld values will arise at the cusp. The Kutta condition (1902) enforces that the trailing edge cusp (c in
ﬁgure 29.8) is actually a stagnation point. The condition thus repairs a mathematical problem in truly ideal
ﬂow by selecting a particular solution. In the real world, a streamlined airfoil under a small angle of attack
in nearly ideal ﬂow will, in fact, fulﬁll the Kutta condition because of viscous friction in the boundary layers
which selects a unique laminar solution.
The problem arises when we attempt to calculate the velocity ﬁeld at a point (x, y) on the airfoil outline
itself, because the integrand of (29.55) is formally inﬁnite for (x , y ) = (x, y). At any point where the
airfoil is smoothly varying, there is in fact no problem and the integral is ﬁnite. To see this we cut out a
small parameter interval θ − < θ < θ + around the singularity in the integrand. Assuming smoothness

in this interval we may expand x − x ≈ (θ − θ )x and y − y = (θ − θ ) y where x = d f x (θ)/dθ and

Here the integral vanishes because of symmetry around the singularity (mathematically it is a principalvalue integral).
The argument fails, however, at the trailing edge for θ = θ1,2 where the airfoil has a sharp cusp. Here
we ﬁnd instead the contributions,

equivalent to the vanishing of the velocity ﬁeld v at the cusp, which is the Kutta condition.

The vortex density γ (θ) must be chosen such that the streamlines follow the airfoil outline. This is
equivalent to requiring the normal component of the velocity ﬁeld to vanish on the impermeable airfoil

determine the vortex density γ (θ).
We are not at liberty to impose a no-slip condition on the ﬁeld, because the Euler equation (16.1) is
only of ﬁrst order in spatial derivatives. Although the ﬁeld (29.55) exists both inside and outside the
airfoil outline, the outside solution now fulﬁlls the Euler equation and obeys the correct boundary
conditions for inviscid ﬂow around a solid body. Consequently, we may with impunity replace the
region inside the airfoil outline with a solid body.
For convenience, the airfoil is positioned with its chord-line on the x-axis such that the asymptotic
velocity becomes U = U (cos α, sin α) (see ﬁgure 29.8). In the θ-parametrization, the tangent vector to the

Marvellously this equation can be integrated over θ. Using that for θ = θ1 we must have x = c and

This is the fundamental equation of two-dimensional airfoil theory. Given the parametrized airfoil geometry
through the functions (x, y) = ( f x (θ), f y (θ)), this integral equation should be solved for the vortex density
γ (θ) = d /dθ.
Having done that, the total circulation may afterwards be obtained by integrating the result,

γ (θ) dθ. Finally, inserting this into the Kutta–Joukowsky theorem (29.51), we obtain the lift. We
θ1
have thus established a precise analytic or numeric procedure which for ideal ﬂow will yield the lift as a
function of the geometry of the airfoil.

Thin airfoil approximation
Even if modern airfoils are much thicker than the airfoils of the early airplanes, the ratio d/c of thickness
to chord is rarely more than 10–15%. Using x as the parameter, a decent approximation for thin airfoils is
obtained by replacing the double layer of circulation density γ± (x) on the two halves of the airfoil outline
by a single layer with circulation density γ (x) distributed along a camber line y(x), where
γ (x) = γ+ (x) + γ− (x),

y(x) = 1 (y+ (x) + y− (x)).

The integral converges because y(x) ∼ c − x for x → c.
Taking into account that the contour of integration in the Kutta–Joukowsky theorem (29.51) is

∗ 29.8 The distant laminar wake
At short distances the velocity ﬁeld is strongly dependent on the shape and attitude of a moving body, but
far from the body such details are lost. It is, as we shall now see, possible to determine the general form
of the laminar velocity ﬁeld at large distances from the body in terms of the lift and drag that the body
produces (see also [38, p. 67]). The analysis in this section should be viewed as the natural continuation
of d’Alembert’s theorem to ﬂuids that are not perfectly inviscid. Such ﬂuids will not ‘close up’ behind the
moving body, but instead—as we have discussed above—leave a trailing wake, a disturbance that never
dies completely out even at huge distance behind the body. In the real unruly and turbulent atmosphere, the
trailing wake from a passing airplane will of course only be notable for a ﬁnite distance.

Oseen’s approximation
Sufﬁciently far from the body, the velocity ﬁeld is laminar and approximatively equal to the asymptotic
value U both inside and outside the trailing wake. Inserting v = U + v into the steady ﬂow Navier–

Flow inside the wake
The trailing wake is assumed to be narrow compared to the distance to the body. In a coordinate system
|y| , |z|, inside the
with the x-axis along the asymptotic velocity, U = U e x , we may assume that x
wake. In the now familiar way, it follows that the double x-derivative in the Laplacian of (29.73) is small
compared with the y, z-derivatives, and the equation for u becomes

(29.75)

This is a standard diffusion equation of the same form as the momentum diffusion equation (17.5) with two
transverse dimensions and ‘time’ t = x/U . Note that t is also the time it takes for the asymptotic ﬂow to
reach the position x downstream from the body.
At distances much larger than the body size, x
L, the body appears as a point particle with no
discernable shape, situated at the origin of the coordinate system. By insertion into the above equation one
may verify that the following expression is an exact ‘shapeless’ solution,
u=

(29.76)

where A = (A x , A y , A z ) is a constant vector. It is in fact also the most general solution at large downstream
distance x (see problem 29.10). Evidently, the distant wake has a Gaussian shape in the transverse directions
√
with a narrow width δ = 4νx/U . The width of the laminar wake is, however, the same in both transverse
directions, conﬁrming that there is no imprint of the original shape of the object on the Gaussian form of
δ, the solution decays as x −1 along the wake, rather than the expected
the distant wake. For |y| , |z|
−2 ≈ x −2 . This is consistent with the area of the wake being of order δ 2 ∼ x such that the volume ﬂux,
r
i.e. the integral of u over the cross section of the wake, remains ﬁnite for x → ∞. The terms that have been
left out in the above solution by dropping the x-derivatives in the Laplacian are a further factor x −1 smaller
than the above solution and cannot contribute in the limit.
The generalized potential is determined by solving (29.74). Consistently leaving out the double
derivatives with respect to the Laplacian, it becomes

potential is an exact solution to this equation inside the wake,

Here the ﬁrst term in the ﬁrst parenthesis is of order x −1/2 and the second of order x −1 . The leading
corrections from leaving out the double x-derivatives in the Laplacian are of order x −3/2 . Only the
exponential in the second parenthesis represents a true solution to the inhomogeneous equation (29.77),
to which one may add an arbitrary solution to Laplace’s equation ∇ 2 = 0. Here we have added the
solution which makes the potential non-singular for y, z → 0.

Since it decays like x −2 and the area of the wake is δ 2 ∼ x, it cannot contribute to drag for x → ∞, so that
the leading contribution to the integrand of (29.45) becomes
p + ρ0 U v x ≈ ρ0 U u x .

(29.80)

In the last step we have dropped the pressure and the potential derivative ∇x ∼ x −3/2 which are both
negligible compared to u x ∼ x −1 . Integrating over all y, z, we ﬁnd from (29.45)
= −ρ0 U

u x d ydz = −4πρ0 ν A x

(29.81)

which ﬁxes the coefﬁcient A x . The errors committed in extending the integral over the wake to all values
of y and z are exponentially small.
The lift is obtained from the complete circulation integral (29.50),
(z) =

C(z)

(u + ∇ ) · d =

u·d =−

u y d y.

In the second step we have used that is single-valued so that ∇ · d = 0, and in the third that u
vanishes outside the wake. The minus sign stems from the contour running through the wake against the
direction of the y-axis. Inserting this result into (29.49) we ﬁnd

Ä = −ρ0U

(29.82)

which ﬁxes A y . Similarly, since there is no lift in the z-direction, we must have A z = 0.
The complete three-dimensional ﬁeld conﬁguration inside the wake has now been obtained in terms of
the lift and drag that the body generates,

Flow outside the wake
Outside the wake, the ﬂow is assumed to be irrotational with v = ∇ and ∇ 2 = 0. We have
before argued that v ∼ 1/r 2 at large distances, and consequently we must have ∼ 1/r . In spherical
coordinates with the polar axis in the x-direction and the null-meridian in the x y-plane, we may thus write

Pressure and lift
Since the leading contribution to pressure vanishes far downstream inside the wake, it plays no role in the
drag which as shown by (29.81) is entirely due to a loss of ﬂuid momentum in the trailing wake. The lift
contribution from pressure stems on the other hand entirely from the outside solution. Using Bernoulli’s

theorem and the spherical derivatives (B.14), the outside pressure becomes, p = −ρ0 U ∇x
−ρ0 U (cos θ∇r − sin θ∇θ ) . After a bit of algebra this reduces to,
p=−

It is immediately clear that the spherically symmetric ﬁrst term cannot contribute to the total pressure force.
Also since d Sx = cos θ · r 2 sin θdθdφ, the second term, which is linear in cos φ, cannot produce a force in
the x-direction, i.e. a drag.
Due to its φ-dependence the second term is, however, negative for y > 0 and positive for y < 0, and
must therefore produce a lift. Using d S y = sin θ cos φ · r 2 sin θdθdφ, we ﬁnd

Pressure thus produces one third of the lift, even for an inﬁnite sphere. The remaining two thirds of lift
stems from momentum ﬂux in the trailing wake. As discussed before (page 452), the partition of lift
between pressure and momentum ﬂux depends on the choice of integration surface at inﬁnity.

The conservation of energy is one of the most fundamental laws of physics. It ﬁrst arose as an almost trivial
consequence of Newton’s equations of motion but was later expanded into the present all-embracing notion
during the development of thermodynamics by Carnot, Joule, Kelvin, Clausius and others in the middle of
the nineteenth century. Thermodynamics has turned out to be one of the most durable physical theories ever
constructed. Although the basic laws are extremely simple, the fundamental concepts are abstract and often
hard to connect with the complex reality of physics and chemistry, and thermodynamics is often perceived
as very difﬁcult at the ﬁrst encounter.
The First Law of Thermodynamics states that there exists an abstract quantity, called energy, which
is independent of the previous history of the system, and which does not change with time for an isolated
system. Energy is abstract in the sense that we cannot afterwards tell how it was put into the system, whether
by heat, by work or by other means. The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that there is another abstract
quantity, called entropy, which is likewise independent of the prehistory of the system, and which cannot
diminish with time for a system in isolation. Entropy is perhaps best understood as a measure of disorder,
informing us about the partition of the stored energy between the random motion of molecules that we call
heat and other forms of energy more directly convertible to work. The inexorable growth of entropy with
time parallels the intuitive notion that disorder spontaneously increases for a system in isolation.
In this chapter only the First Law of Thermodynamics for continuous systems is discussed, completing
thereby the analysis of laws of balance begun in chapter 22. For more complete presentations of continuum
thermodynamics and the Second Law, see [7, 14, 37, 24, 72]. Convection, the dynamic interplay of ﬂow
and heat, will be treated in chapter 31.

30.1 Energy balance
The First Law of Thermodynamics postulates (1) that the energy of a physical system is only a function
of the instantaneous state, i.e. of the macroscopic ﬁelds which characterize the state of the system, and (2)
that energy is conserved in a system that is isolated from its environment. For a non-isolated system, any
change in energy can therefore be accounted for by the actions of the environment. In terms of the heat Q
transferred to the system and the work W performed on the system, the First Law takes the form,
= Q + W.

(30.1)

Whereas heat and work may depend on the history of how the environment interacted with the system, their
sum does not, because energy is only a function of the instantaneous state. If the environment can inﬂuence
the system in other ways, for example through chemical reactions, further terms have to be included on the
right-hand side.

30. HEAT

First Law in continuum physics
Continuous systems are of course also physical systems, so the First Law must by default be valid in
continuum physics, provided the possibility of material ﬂow through the surface of the control volume is
taken properly into account. In an arbitrary moving control volume, the First Law turns into an equation of
balance for the material rate of change of the total energy,
D
˙
˙
= Q + W,
Dt

(30.2)

˙
˙
where Q is the rate at which the environment transfers heat to the system, and W is the rate of work
performed on the system by the environment.
It is a basic assumption in continuum physics that energy is an extensive quantity, transported by
material particles. The energy of a control volume is as any other extensive quantity an integral,
=

V

ρ d V,

(30.3)

where the energy density ρ = d /d V is the product of the mass density ρ and the speciﬁc energy
= d /d M. The material time derivative of the energy then obeys Reynolds theorem (22.10) with q → ,
d
D
=
+ ρ (v − v S ) · d S.
Dt
dt
S

(30.4)

The last term represents the net outﬂow of energy from the control volume.

Rate of work
The environment can perform work on a system through long-range body forces such as gravity and
electromagnetism, and through contact forces acting on the surface of the control volume. The rate of
work of the contact forces is,
˙
W=

S

v · σ · d S,

(30.5)

where σ = {σi j } is the stress ﬁeld. If external body forces, for example gravity, also act on the material
in the control volume, their rate of work must be added to the right-hand side. Alternatively, a static
external gravitational ﬁeld can be included as a potential energy term in the total energy (see section 22.8 on
page 318), and the same is possible for external electrostatic forces. When all body forces are ‘internalized’
as potential energy, we only need to account for the environment’s work on the system through contact
forces, as given by the above expression. We shall assume this to be the case in the following.

Rate of heat transfer
The everyday experience of handling a hot potato tells us that heat can be carried along with the movement
of matter, but that possibility is already taken care of in the equation of energy balance (30.2) through the
use of the material derivative, effectively turning the arbitrary control volume into a comoving volume.
When we heat water to make tea, it becomes equally clear that heat can also be conducted through the
solid bottom of the kettle. Heat transfer by conduction is not an advective transport phenomenon tied to the
motion of material particles, but is rather a diffusion process by which the warmer material particles of the
wall ‘infect’ the colder particles of the water with heat.
Macroscopically we describe the ﬂow of heat through a surface by a current density (vector) ﬁeld
q(x, t), deﬁned such that the amount of heat which ﬂows through a surface element d S in the time interval
δt is δ Q = qδt · d S. The total rate of heat transfer into the system thus becomes,
˙
Q=−

where we have also allowed for the possibility that heat may be produced at a rate h(x, t) per unit of volume

Example 30.1.1 (Geothermal heat ﬂow): The Earth produces heat in the interior by radioactivity, and
the average geothermal heat current is qc ≈ 0.06 W m−2 for the continents and qs ≈ 0.10 W m−2
for the seas [34, p. 192]. Given that the Earth’s mean radius is a = 6371 km, and that the

consumption is about 13 × 10

Internal energy and heat equation
Separating out the kinetic energy Ì and the potential energy Î , we shall write the total energy as,
= Ì + Î + Í,

(30.7)

where the remainder Í is called the internal energy. Since energy is an extensive quantity, the internal
energy must also be an integral over a density,

Í=

V

ρ u d V,

(30.8)

where u = d Í /d M is the speciﬁc internal energy. Using the usual expressions for the kinetic energy
(22.34) and the potential energy (22.50) the speciﬁc total energy becomes
=

v +

+ u.

(30.9)

At this point we do not know the nature of the system and cannot be more explicit about the precise form
of the speciﬁc internal energy.

where P is the reduced power, i.e. the total power (22.37) without the contribution due to the rate of work

DÍ

˙

Dt

(30.10)

where Wint is the rate of work against internal stresses (22.38). It represents the rate at which kinetic energy
is converted into internal energy by internal stresses, also called dissipation.
Transforming the surface integral in (30.6) into a volume integral by means of Gauss’ theorem, and
making use of (22.11) with q → u, it follows that the speciﬁc internal energy must obey the local equation,
ρ

Du

where the last term is the density of dissipation. Given explicit expressions for the speciﬁc internal energy
u, the current of heat conduction q, the rate of heat production per unit of volume h, and the internal stress
ﬁeld σ , this equation becomes a dynamic equation for the temperature ﬁeld, called the heat equation.

30.2 Heat equation for isotropic matter at rest
The Second Law of Thermodynamics implies that in an isolated system heat will spontaneously stream
from regions of higher to regions of lower temperatures (and conversely: this general rule is equivalent

to the Second Law). We expect for this reason that the heat ﬂow q is locally related to the gradient of the
temperature ﬁeld ∇T . In isotropic matter, the simplest local relationship is Fourier’s law of heat conduction,
q = −k∇T,

(30.12)

where the sign has been chosen so that heat is conducted from hot to cold. The positive constant k is called
the thermal conductivity of the material, and is measured in units of watts per kelvin per metre. For water it
−1

is k ≈ 0.6 W K−1 m and for air k ≈ 0.025 W K−1 m−1 .
In the following we shall always assume Fourier’s law to be valid.
Example 30.2.1 (Geothermal gradient): The average continental geothermal heat ﬂow is qc ≈
0.06 W m−2 [34]. Taking the thermal conductivity of bedrock to be k ≈ 2 W K−1 m−1 [41], the
average geothermal temperature gradient in the upper crust becomes |∇T | ≈ qc /k ≈ 0.03 K m−1 , or
30 kelvin per kilometre. It must be emphasized that the geothermal gradient varies strongly from place
to place because of variations in the composition of the upper crust.

Fourier’s equation
The simplest of all materials is an incompressible homogeneous isotropic ﬂuid (or solid) at rest with
constant mass density ﬁeld, ρ = ρ0 . In such a material there is only one free thermodynamic variable,
which may be taken to be the temperature ﬁeld T = T (x, t), and any other local thermodynamic quantity,
for example the speciﬁc energy u = u(T ), becomes a local function of the temperature. We shall for
simplicity assume that the speciﬁc energy is linear in the temperature, u = c0 T , or at least linear in a
certain temperature range. The constant c0 is the speciﬁc heat capacity of the material, deﬁned as the
amount of heat necessary to raise a unit of mass by one unit of temperature1 .
Inserting u = c0 T and v = 0 into the equation of local internal energy balance (30.11), and using
Fourier’s law of heat conduction (30.12), we obtain the heat equation for isotropic matter at rest,
ρ0 c0

∂T
= k∇2 T + h.
∂t

(30.13)

Dividing by ρ0 c0 it takes (for h = 0) the form of a standard diffusion equation, called Fourier’s equation
∂T
= κ∇ 2 T,
∂t

(30.14)

with heat diffusivity,
κ=

k
.
ρ0 c0

(30.15)

For water we have κ ≈ 1.4 × 10−7 m2 s−1 which is about 6 times smaller than the momentum diffusivity
(kinematic viscosity) ν. Somewhat surprisingly, the heat diffusivity of air turns out to be 140 times larger
than for water (see page 475).
Why is it then that we use air for insulation in thermoglass windows, bed covers and winter coats—
rather than sleeping and walking in wetsuits? The explanation is that although heat diffuses about
140 times quicker in air than in water, the actual heat current (30.12) is for a given temperature
gradient not determined by the diffusivity but by the thermal conductivity, k, which is about 25 times
larger in water than in air. Consequently, you lose less heat in a fur coat than in a wetsuit even if
the cold penetrates the fur coat much faster. The role of a fur coat or wetsuit is mainly to prevent
advection of heat by air or water currents which will rapidly remove the warm ﬂuid adjacent to your
skin, increasing thereby the temperature gradient at the skin and thus the heat ﬂow from your body.
1 There is a small ambiguity of language when we use the verb ‘heat’ to mean both to ‘raise the temperature’ and
to ‘add heat’. It is perfectly possible to add heat to a system without raising its temperature, for example when boiling
water. Conversely, the temperature may rise without heat transfer when you pump your bicycle tyre.

Heat diffusion time
The analogy between Fourier’s equation (30.14) and the planar momentum diffusion equation (17.5) on
page 232 allows us immediately to take the solution (17.12) and adapt it to a uniform planar Gaussian
temperature distribution in the yz-plane. Let the planar temperature ﬁeld initially at t = 0 be Gaussian,
T = T0 + exp(−x 2 /a 2 ), where is the temperature excess at x = 0. At a later time the temperature
ﬁeld will then be,
T (x, t) = T0 +

x2
exp − 2
a + 4κ t
a 2 + 4κ t
a

.

(30.16)

It may of course be veriﬁed by direct insertion that this solution indeed satisﬁes Fourier’s equation. The
temperature distribution thus remains Gaussian at all times with a width that grows like a 2 + 4κ t with
time. Since the environment transfers no heat to the system and performs no work on it (because the material
is everywhere at rest), the total internal energy in the heated material must remain constant while it spreads
away from the central region (problem 30.1).
At large times, t
a 2 /4κ , the Gaussian factor exp(−x 2 /4κ t) becomes universal for all bounded
temperature distributions. The strong fall-off of the Gaussian makes it appear as if the temperature excess
√
T = T − T0 expands with a well-deﬁned front. At the distance x = 2 κ t the Gaussian has fallen to
−1 ≈ 37% of its central value. Depending on the application it may be more convenient to choose a more
e
√
conservative front, for example x = 3.5 κ t where the Gaussian is only about 5% of its central value.
Conversely, one may also characterize heat diffusion by the characteristic time it takes for the front to
reach a distance x = L
a . At the 37% level, this time becomes,
t≈

L2
.
4κ

(30.17)

For a more conservative deﬁnition of the front, a correspondingly smaller estimate may be used, for example
t ≈ L 2 /12κ for the 5% level. Such estimates are in fact very general and may be used to get an idea of the
heat diffusion time in any system.
Example 30.2.2 (Hot porridge): Everybody has painfully learnt early in life that the centre of a bowl
of hot porridge may remain hot for a long time, even as the periphery grows cold. Taking the heat
diffusivity of porridge to be equal to that of water, the time it takes for a spherical ball of hot porridge
of radius a ≈ 5 cm to reach room temperature is estimated from (30.17) to be 4500 s, or about an hour
and a quarter. Parents have found a solution to this problem (see example 30.3.1 below).

Planar heat wave
Similarly, we may adapt the plane wave solution (17.14). Suppose the temperature is forced to oscillate
sinusoidally in the plane z = 0 with period τ and amplitude
around the mean temperature T0 , such
that T = T0 + cos(2πt/τ ) at z = 0. Recasting the solution (17.14) in terms of these variables, with
ω → 2π/τ and k → 1/d, it becomes a damped heat wave in which the temperature at depth z is,
T = T0 +

π

(30.18)

where d is the penetration depth. The corresponding wavelength is λ = 2πd, and at a depth of one
wavelength the damping factor is e−2π = 1.8 × 10−3 .
Example 30.2.3 (Annual soil temperature variation): The surface temperature of soil follows the
annual variations in atmospheric temperature with period τ = 1 year = 3.2 × 107 s. The thermal
conductivity of soil consisting of sand, stones, and clay, is probably not unlike that of water with, say,
k ≈ 0.5 W K−1 m−1 , density ρ ≈ 2 g cm−3 , and speciﬁc heat capacity about c0 ≈ 2 J g−1 K−1 ,
implying a heat diffusivity of around κ ≈ 1.3 × 10−7 m2 s−1 , which is nearly identical to that of
water. The soil penetration depth becomes d = 1.1 m, meaning that the amplitude of the temperature
variations at this depth has fallen to e−1 = 37% of the surface amplitude (see ﬁgure 30.1). Since the
wavelength is 2π ≈ 6 times the penetration depth, the surface temperatures will be delayed by about 2
months at z = d.

The plates continue far above and

The ﬂuid is at rest and there is no

Suppose a slab of isotropic material at rest is enclosed between two inﬁnitely extended ﬂat plates held at
different temperatures, T0 and T1 = T0 + . The planar symmetry suggests that the temperature ﬁeld only

depends on the transverse coordinate, T = T (x). Inserting this into Fourier’s equation we obtain ∇x T = 0
which has the solution

(30.19)
T (x) = T0 +
d
where d is the distance between the plates. Although heat conduction is necessary for establishing a ﬂow
of heat, the ﬁnal distribution does not depend on the value of the coefﬁcient of thermal conductivity. As we
shall now see, thermal conductivity determines instead the time scale for the appearance of a steady ﬂow
pattern. This is completely analogous to velocity-driven planar ﬂow between moving plates which does not
depend on the viscosity (section 17.2 on page 231), although viscosity does determine the time scale for the
ﬂow to settle down into a steady pattern.

Steady heat production
If heat is produced at a constant rate h per unit of volume and if the environment has constant properties, an
equilibrium will eventually be attained in which the heat produced in a volume equals the amount of heat
that leaves the volume. The temperature ﬁeld will then become time-independent and obey the steady heat
equation (30.13),
k∇ 2 T + h = 0.

(30.20)

Given the heat production and suitable boundary conditions this equation determines the temperature
distribution. Often h will itself vary with temperature because the heat producing processes are temperaturedependent.
Suppose nevertheless that heat is produced at a ﬁxed rate h(x, t) = h 0 inside a sphere of radius a,

Example 30.2.4 (Geothermal heat production): The total geothermal heat output of the Earth
˙
is Q ≈ 45 × 1012 W (see example 30.1.1), implying an average (radioactive) heat production rate
h 0 ≈ 4 × 10−8 W m−3 . If the Earth were made from uniform material with k ≈ 2 W K−1 m−1 , the
central temperature excess would be Tc − Ts ≈ 140 000 K. This estimate fails miserably in comparison
with geophysical models which place the central temperature at 4000–6000 K, demonstrating that the
Earth is a highly non-uniform object with respect to heat transfer. In the liquid mantle rapid convection
rather than slow conduction is the dominant mechanism of heat transfer, although thermal conductivity
also increases with depth.

Example 30.2.5 (Human skin temperature): The average heat output from a human being is
˙
Q ≈ 100 W (for example used for dimensioning cooling systems for concert halls). With a typical mass
of M ≈ 70 kg and density equal to that of water ρ0 ≈ 1000 kg m−3 the volume becomes V = 0.07 m3 ,
implying an average heat production density rate h 0 ≈ 1.4 kW m−3 . In the ‘spherical approximation’ a
human body of this mass would have radius a ≈ 0.25 m, and using (30.22) with k = 0.6 W K−1 m−1
we obtain the difference between the average temperature and the skin temperature T − Ts ≈ 10 K.
Taking T = 37 ◦ C, the skin temperature is predicted to be 27 ◦ C. The conclusion is that a naked
human being should be able to survive ‘indeﬁnitely’ in water of this temperature, a result which agrees
decently with common experience (see also problem 30.6).

30.3 Heat equation for ﬂuids in motion
The dominant effect of the velocity of a moving ﬂuid is advective transport of internal energy, expressed
through the material derivative on the left-hand side of the equation of local internal energy balance (30.11).
The last term on the right-hand side also depends on the velocity but it only plays a role for compressible
or viscous ﬂuids. Even then, dissipative heating will only be important under extreme circumstances, for
example at the leading edges of a supersonic aircraft or a spacecraft re-entering the atmosphere.

Incompressible inviscid ﬂuid
For an incompressible inviscid ﬂuid the heat equation takes (in the absence of heat production) almost the
same form as Fourier’s equation (30.14),
∂T
+ (v · ∇)T = κ∇ 2 T.
∂t

(30.23)

The extra advective term on the left-hand side expresses that heat moves along with the ﬂow of matter,
whereas the right-hand side expresses that it also streams down temperature gradients as for a ﬂuid at rest.
We shall see below that this heat equation can essentially always be maintained when the ﬂuid is nearly
inviscid and the ﬂow speed is small compared to the velocity of sound.

The Peclet number

Jean-Claude Eugene Peclet
´
(1793–1857). French physicist.
One of the ﬁrst scholars of Ecole
Normale (Paris); known for his
clarity of style, sharp-minded
views
and
well-performed
experiments.

The time it takes for heat to be advected by the ﬂow of ﬂuid with velocity U through a distance L
is tadv ∼ L/ U whereas the time it takes for it to diffuse through the same distance is tdiff ∼ L 2 /κ ,
disregarding all purely numeric factors. The ratio of the time scales for diffusion and ﬂow is an important
dimensionless quantity, called the P´ clet number, Pe ∼ tdiff / tadv ∼ U L/κ .
e
More formally, and in analogy with the Reynolds number, the Peclet number is deﬁned to be the ratio
´
of the advective to diffusive terms in the heat equation,
Pe =

|(v · ∇)T |
κ∇2 T

≈

UL
.
κ

(30.24)

The value of the Peclet number determines whether heat ﬂow in a ﬂuid is dominated by advection or by
´
conduction. For large Peclet numbers the right-hand side of the heat equation (30.23) can be disregarded,
´
and the heat equation now simply says that the temperature is constant around any comoving material
particle. The smallness of the heat diffusivity in most materials usually makes the Peclet number quite
´
large for ﬂows of ordinary dimensions and ﬂow speeds. For small Peclet number, the advective term can be
´
disregarded, and the heat equation reverts to that of a ﬂuid at rest.
Example 30.3.1 (Cooling hot porridge): The parental solution to the problem of the hot porridge (see
example 30.2.2) is to stir it a few times with a spoon. Stirring sets the porridge into motion and the heat
(or rather the internal energy) is carried along with the porridge by advection. Mixing the hot and cold
regions increases the local temperature gradients, resulting in a large diffusive heat ﬂow which quickly
evens out the temperature differences and makes the porridge eatable. During stirring, layers of hot and
cold porridge are interwoven with each other, lowering the typical distance scale to perhaps L = 1 cm.
Taking U = 10 cm s−1 and the diffusivity to be approximatively that of water, κ ≈ 1.4×10−7 m2 s−1 ,
we ﬁnd a P´ clet number of Pe ≈ 7000, showing that heat conduction can safely be ignored while you
e
stir. Diffusive cooling due to the larger temperature gradients mainly takes place when you stop stirring
after a few seconds. The heat diffusion time (30.17) in the stirred porridge is now estimated to be of the
order of minutes.

Compressible ideal gas
In section 22.9 on page 319 we calculated the speciﬁc internal energy (22.60) of a compressible ideal gas
with adiabatic index γ (see also appendix C). As for incompressible ﬂuid, the speciﬁc energy density was
found to be linear in the absolute temperature2 ,
cv =

u = cv T,

R

,
γ − 1 Mmol

(30.25)

where the constant cv is the speciﬁc heat at constant density (i.e. volume). It represents—as the ﬁrst equation
shows—the amount of energy that is necessary to raise a unit of mass of the gas by one unit of temperature.
If the density (volume) is held constant, so that no work is performed on the gas, this is the same as the
amount of heat that must be transferred to a unit mass of the gas to raise its temperature by one unit.
If on the other hand the pressure is held constant, the amount of heat that must be transferred to a unit
mass of the gas to raise its temperature by one unit is instead,
c p = cv +

R

called the speciﬁc heat at constant pressure or the isobaric speciﬁc heat.
Disregarding viscous friction and heat production, local internal energy balance (30.11) becomes,
ρcv

∂T
+ (v · ∇)T
∂t

= k∇ 2 T − p∇ · v,

(30.27)

2 Although this expression was derived under the assumption of adiabatic (isentropic) processes, it must be correct in
general because energy is only a function of the ﬁnal state and not of the particular road that leads to this state, whether
adiabatic or not.

where the pressure is given by the ideal gas law, p = ( R/ Mmol )ρ T . The ﬁrst source term on the righthand side represents the local inﬂow of heat by conduction whereas the last represents the work of local
compression (because it is positive when ∇ · v < 0). We shall justify below that if the ﬂow velocity is much
smaller than the speed of sound, the local compression source can be ‘moved over’ to the left-hand side,
replacing the speciﬁc heat at constant volume by the speciﬁc heat at constant pressure,
ρc p

∂T
+ (v · ∇)T
∂t

= k ∇ 2 T.

(30.28)

It is of the same form as for an incompressible ﬂuid, except for the use of the speciﬁc heat at constant
pressure, but it should be remembered that this is only an approximation (valid at small ﬂow speeds) to the
correct equation (30.27).
The heat diffusivity is now deﬁned as,
κ=

ρc p

(30.29)

For air at normal temperature and pressure, we have κ ≈ 2 × 10−5 m2 s−1 which as mentioned before is
about 140 times larger than that of water.

(30.30)

For steady nearly ideal ﬂow and in the absence of gravity, Bernoulli’s theorem (16.15) relates a change in
pressure to a change in ﬂow velocity, p ≈ −1/2ρ (v 2 ). A change in the absolute temperature is related
2
to a change in the velocity of sound (16.9), from which we get T ∼ (cs )Mmol /Rγ . The ratio of the
two terms on the left-hand side of the heat equation may thus be estimated as,

In the last steps we have disregarded all factors of order unity. This argument suggests that the material
pressure derivative can be disregarded in steady ﬂow at high Reynolds number as long as the ﬂow speed is
much smaller than the speed of sound (which also makes the ﬂow effectively incompressible; see section
16.4 on page 213). For general unsteady ﬂow there will be further conditions on the rate of change of the
pressure, ∂ p/∂t, and on the ﬁeld of gravity (see [7] for a more careful discussion).

General isotropic ﬂuid
In a general isotropic ﬂuid, the speciﬁc internal energy will depend on both the temperature and the mass
density, u = u(T, ρ), and derivation of the heat equation becomes considerably more involved, requiring
the full apparatus of thermodynamics. An account close in spirit to the presentation in this chapter is found
in [7]. The end result is that for nearly inviscid and nearly incompressible ﬂows the heat equation again
takes the form (30.28) with heat diffusivity determined from the isobaric speciﬁc heat of the ﬂuid (30.29). In
liquids there is not a great difference between the speciﬁc heats at constant volume and at constant pressure.
The internal friction caused by the stresses in a viscous ﬂuid leads to a loss of kinetic energy which
reappears as source of internal energy (i.e. internal work) in the last term in the equation of internal energy

where h is the local rate of heat production, vi j the symmetric strain rate (17.29), η the shear viscosity and
ζ is the bulk viscosity.
In most everyday ﬂows heat production by dissipation will be negligible in comparison with advection
and conduction. In extreme situations with strong compression and shear, temperatures can become
extremely high. A hypersonic object like a ‘shooting star’ may even burn up completely when entering
the atmosphere at more than 10 km s−1 .

Pr

When you take a walk on a cold day, your heat loss is ampliﬁed by wind which removes the warm air
near your body and creates a large temperature gradient at the surface of the skin, resulting in a larger
conductive heat transfer from your body to the air. In meteorology this is known as wind chill, and the local
‘wind chill temperature’ is often announced by weather forecasters during winter. A similar phenomenon
must of course occur in a hot desert wind, although the local ‘wind burn’ is not a regular part of a summer
weather forecast. In a sauna with air at 120 ◦ C, it is well known that one should not move around too fast.
Water chill is even more important. A cold water current moving with the same speed and temperature
as a cold wind results in much stronger cooling because of the 25 times higher thermal conductivity of
water. This is why you are only able to survive naked for minutes in streaming water at 0 ◦ C whereas you
may survive for hours in a wind of that temperature. Similarly, hot water scalds you much faster than hot
air of the same temperature.
In this section we shall discuss the limit where the temperature does not inﬂuence the motion of the ﬂuid.
In that case the ﬂow of heat takes place against the background of a mass ﬂow, completely controlled by
the external forces that drive the ﬂuid. This limit is often called the limit of forced convection to distinguish
it from the opposite limit, free convection, where the motion of the ﬂuid is entirely caused by temperature
differences (to be discussed at length in chapter 31).

Prandtl numbers.

The Prandtl number
Advective cooling (or heating) of the surface of a body involves both momentum and heat diffusion along
the normal to the surface. In a time t after the start of the ﬂow, momentum diffusion reaches a characteristic
√
√
distance δmass ∼ νt from the surface whereas heat diffusion reaches δheat ∼ κt. The ratio between
momentum and heat diffusivities is for this reason an important dimensionless quantity, called the Prandtl
number,
Pr =

ν
.
κ

(30.33)

When the Prandtl number is large, temperature variations will take place well inside the usual boundary
layer, whereas if the Prandtl number is small, the temperature distribution spreads well beyond the boundary
layer.
In contrast to other dimensionless numbers, for example the Reynolds or P´ clet numbers, the Prandtl
e
number is a property of the ﬂuid rather than of the ﬂow. In gases it is of order unity, for example
Pr = 0.73 for air at normal temperature and pressure. In liquids it may take a wide range of values:
in water it is about 6, whereas in liquid metals it is quite small, for example 0.025 for mercury. For
isolating liquids like oil it may be quite large, of the order of 1000.

Wind chill estimate
In a steady ﬂow with velocity scale U boundary layers will stop growing after the time t ∼ L/U it takes
for the ﬂuid to move across the downstream length L of the body. The scale of the heat boundary layer

thickness thus becomes δheat ∼ κ L/ U , and the temperature gradient at the surface is expected to be

is the temperature excess of the body relative to the ﬂuid at large. From
Fourier’s law (30.12) we estimate that the rate of loss of heat from a body surface of area A is,

κL

(30.34)

We shall show below in an exact calculation that this is indeed of the right form.
The main consequence of the above estimate is that the heat loss grows with the square root of the
velocity, thus conﬁrming the observation that a higher velocity has the same effect as a larger temperature
excess. Let the actual temperature excess be
= T1 − T0 where T1 is the temperature of the exposed
the
surface and T0 is the wind temperature, and let the actual wind velocity be U . Then√ heat loss will be the
√

U . Solving
same for a temperature excess ∗ = T1 − T0 and a wind speed U ∗ , satisfying ∗ U ∗ =
∗ we ﬁnd,
for the (ﬁctive) wind temperature T0
U
∗
.
(30.35)
T0 = T1 − (T1 − T0 )
U∗
Apart from corrections for high wind speeds, this is essentially identical to the ﬁrst wind chill formula
by Siple and Passel (1945), who—after measuring cooling rates of water in plastic containers—chose the
nominal values T1 ≈ 33 ◦ C and U ∗ ≈ 5 m s−1 . The Siple–Passel formula was used by the US National
Weather Service from 1973 but was in 2001 replaced by a more conservative expression based on modern
theory and experiments.
Example 30.4.1: At 0 ◦ C a wind speed of U = 10 m s−1 corresponds to a ﬁctive wind temperature of
∗
∗
T0 ≈ −14 ◦ C according to (30.35). The modern formula yields instead T0 ≈ −7 ◦ C.

Heat ﬂow in the Blasius boundary layer
The simplest model of advective cooling is furnished by the steady-ﬂow Blasius boundary layer discussed
in section 28.4 on page 414, with the added condition that the plate is held at a constant temperature
T = T0 + which is different from the ambient temperature T0 . Since by assumption the mass ﬂow is not
inﬂuenced by the heat ﬂow we may take the exact Blasius solution and insert it into the steady ﬂow heat
equation,
(v · ∇)T = κ∇ 2 T.

(30.36)

In the boundary layer approximation the double derivative ∇x can be disregarded in the Laplacian, so that
the equation takes the same form as the Prandtl equation (28.21)

Assuming that the temperature only depends on the scaling variable s = y U/2νx , we may write (a
general discussion of heat ﬂow in boundary layers is found in [61]),
F(s),

where F(s) is a dimensionless function. In the same way as for Blasius’ equation (28.26) it follows that,
F (s) + Pr g(s)F (s) = 0,

(30.39)

The slope −F (0) = 1/H (∞) is plotted as a function of the Prandtl number in ﬁgure 30.2b. Note that
this is not quite of the same form as the previous estimate (30.34) because it has ν instead of κ in the
denominator of the square root. The √
explanation is that for Pr
1 the slope varies like the square root
of the Prandtl number, −F (0) ≈ 0.8 Pr, bringing the estimate into agreement with the exact calculation
(see problem 30.7).
Example 30.4.2 (Human heat loss): The grown-up human body has a skin surface area of about
A ≈ 2 m2 . A naked human standing with shoulders aligned with the wind will roughly present a (twosided) plate area with L ≈ 0.5 m and A/L ≈ 4 m. For air with Pr = 0.73 we have −F (0) = 0.42, so
that in a wind with U = 1 m s−1 and a temperature = 10 K below the skin temperature we ﬁnd the
˙
heat loss rate Q ≈ 100 W. Since the human body produces heat at this rate, a skin temperature of 27 ◦ C
can thus be maintained essentially indeﬁnitely in a gentle breeze with velocity 1 m s−1 and temperature
17 ◦ C, not unlike what you ﬁnd on a Scandinavian beach on a summer day. In this calculation we have
ignored natural convection and evaporative heat losses.
Under the same conditions in water where −F (0) = 0.87 the rate of heat loss becomes enormous,
˙
Q ≈ 23 kW, and will almost instantly cool the skin to the temperature of the water. Everybody is
familiar with the (relatively mild) skin shock that is experienced when one jumps into water as warm as
17 ◦ C. At this temperature the loss of heat will eventually lead to severe hypothermia and death in the
course of some hours, depending on what you wear and how you behave.

Convection is a major driving agent behind most of the weather phenomena in the atmosphere, from
ordinary cyclones to hurricanes, thunderstorms and tornadoes. Continental drift on Earth as well as transport
of heat from the centre of a planet or star to the surface are also mainly driven by convection. On a smaller
scale, we use heat convection in the home to create a natural circulation which transports heat around the
rooms from the radiators of the central heating system. The circulation of water in the central heating
system also used to be driven by convection, but is today mostly driven by pumps.
The mechanism behind convection rests on a combination of material properties and gravity. Most
ﬂuids, even those we call incompressible, tend to expand when the temperature is raised, leading to a slight
decrease in density. Were it not for gravity, the minuscule changes in density caused by local temperature
variations would be of very little consequence, but gravity makes the warmer and lighter ﬂuid buoyant
relative to the colder and heavier, and the buoyancy forces will attempt to set the ﬂuid into motion. Such
heat-driven motion is called convection, and will in fact arise naturally in the presence of gravity wherever
there are sufﬁciently large local variations in the temperature of a ﬂuid.
In this chapter we shall ﬁrst discuss some examples of steady laminar convection ﬂows driven by
time-independent temperature differences on the container boundaries. Afterwards we shall address the
thermal instabilities characterizing the onset of convection. Of particular interest are the Rayleigh–B´ nard
e
instabilities in a horizontal layer of ﬂuid heated from below.

31.1 Convection
Convection is caused by buoyancy forces in combination with the tendency for most materials to expand
when heated1 . The coupled partial differential equations controlling the interplay of heat and motion are
generally so complex that exact solutions are completely out of the question. Numeric simulations are,
however, possible and used wherever practical problems have to be solved. Analytic insight into convection
is mainly obtained from an approximation developed by Boussinesq in 1902.
1 Concentration gradients in mixed ﬂuids can also cause convective ﬂow. In this book we reserve the word ‘convection’
to denote a ﬂow that is mainly driven by temperature differences in conjunction with buoyancy, whereas ‘advection’ is
used to denote heat transport in a ﬂow mainly driven by other forces. In practice both mechanisms are at play, and
sometimes it is useful instead to distinguish between free and forced convection.

It is a material ‘constant’ and for ideal gases where ρ ∝ p/T one ﬁnds α = 1/T , i.e. about α ≈

water which has α ≈ 2.5 × 10−4 K−1 at 25 ◦ C. Water is in many respects exceptional with a negative
expansion coefﬁcient between 0 and 4 ◦ C, and a solid phase (ice) that is lighter than the liquid.
Turning the above deﬁnition around we may calculate the change in density,
ρ = −α Tρ,

(31.2)

change causes an extra gravitational force density, a buoyancy term ρ g 0 for T > 0, to appear on the

The Boussinesq approximation
Suppose an effectively incompressible ﬂuid is initially at rest in constant gravity g 0 = (0, 0, −g0 ) with
constant density ρ0 , temperature T0 and hydrostatic pressure p = p0 − ρ0 g0 z. At a certain time the
boundary temperatures are changed, and the resulting ﬂow of heat changes the temperature in the ﬂuid and
thereby its density, eventually resulting in a convective ﬂow with velocity ﬁeld v.
The main assumption behind the Boussinesq approximation is that the temperature variations are
small on the scale set by the thermal expansion coefﬁcient, i.e. |α T |
1 where T = T − T0 ,
and the change in density is to ﬁrst order given by (31.2) with ρ = ρ0 . Adding the buoyancy term
ρ g 0 = −ρ0 α T g 0 to the Navier–Stokes equation, and cancelling out the normal hydrostatic pressure by
writing p = p0 − ρ0 g0 z + p, the Boussinesq equations for an effectively incompressible ﬂuid become,

The complete and correct derivation of the Boussinesq approximation is however not without subtlety (see

Steady convection in open vertical slot heated on one side
We have previously (page 472) discussed the steady heat ﬂow in a ﬂuid at rest between two plates, one
of which was situated at x = 0 with temperature T0 and the other at x = d with higher temperature
T1 = T0 + . The result was that the temperature rises linearly across the slot. If the plates are vertical,
buoyancy forces will act on the heated ﬂuid and unavoidably set it into motion. For deﬁniteness, the plates
are assumed to be large but ﬁnite with the openings at the top and bottom connected to a reservoir of the
same ﬂuid at the same temperature T0 as the cold plate. This provides the correct hydrostatic pressure at the

top and bottom of the slot, a pressure which is necessary to prevent the ﬂuid in the slot from ‘falling out’
under its own weight, even before it is heated. Heating will cause the ﬂuid in the slot to rise and merge with
the ﬂuid in the reservoir, and it seems reasonable to expect that a steady ﬂow of heat and ﬂuid may come
about, in which the ﬂuid rises fastest near the warm plate. The reservoir is assumed to be so large that it
never changes its temperature, except near the exit from the slot.
From the planar symmetry of the conﬁguration we expect that the velocity ﬁeld is vertical everywhere,
and that it and the temperature ﬁeld depend only on x,
v = (0, 0, vz (x)),

T = T (x).

Under these assumptions, there will be no advective contribution to the heat equation (31.4a), which

becomes ∇x T = 0. The temperature thus varies linearly with x across the slot, and using the boundary
conditions we get,
T =

z

(31.6)

just as in the static case (30.19).
From the assumed form of the velocity ﬁeld it also follows that the advective term in (31.4b) vanishes,
and from the x, y-components of this equation we conclude that ∇x p = ∇ y p = 0, such that the pressure
can only depend on z. From the z-component we then get

Since the left-hand side depends only on z and the right-hand side only on x, both sides of this equation

in the above calculation. For air the velocity is U ≈ 8 cm s−1 and the Reynolds number is Re ≈ 50.

where L is the size of the slot in the y-direction. This raises a puzzle because the temperature gradient is
constant, ∇x T = /d, across the slot, and Fourier’s law (30.12) then implies that the same amount of
heat is added to the ﬂuid at the warm plate as is removed at the cold. Consequently, no net heat is added to
the ﬂuid from the plates, in blatant contradiction with the above calculation and common experience.
What is wrong is the assumption that the solutions (31.6) and (31.7) are valid at the bottom of the slot
where the ﬂuid enters. Here the temperature gradient cannot be constant, because mass conservation in the
steady state forces the cold ﬂuid to enter with the same average velocity U given by (31.8). Since it takes
a certain amount of time, t ≈ d 2 /4κ, for the heat supplied by the warm plate to diffuse across the slot (see
equation (30.17)), the ﬂuid will have moved through a vertical distance

the Rayleigh number whereas the viscous entrance length (21.22) in units of the slot width is estimated to
be about 2% of the Reynolds number.
Example 31.1.2: In the preceding example 31.1.1 the Rayleigh number for water becomes Ra =

∗ Thermal boundary layer

¹x

Outline of thermal boundary
layers forming on both sides
of a thin plate with constant
temperature T1 = T0 + ,
placed vertically in an inﬁnite sea
of ﬂuid originally at rest with
temperature T0 . The layer has a
z-dependent thickness δ(z).

If the entrance length is much greater than the height of the slot,
h, the heated ﬂuid will never reach the
cold plate before it exits from the slot. In this limit, the cold plate can be ignored, and the appropriate model
is instead that of a warm vertical plate with constant temperature placed in a sea of cold ﬂuid. The heated
ﬂuid rising along the plate then forms a thermal boundary layer, and we shall now determine the steady
laminar ﬂow pattern in such a boundary layer by combining the Boussinesq approximation with Prandtl’s
boundary layer approximation (section 28.3 on page 413).
The coordinate system is chosen with the positive z-axis along the plate. Replacing by z and d by
δ(z) in the estimate of the heat entrance length (31.11) we obtain an estimate of the z-dependent thickness
of the boundary layer (apart from a dimensionless numerical factor),

(31.14)

Since for z → ∞ we have δ/z ∝ z −3/4 the boundary layer may indeed be viewed as thin, except for a
region near the leading edge of the plate.
Under these circumstances we may apply the Prandtl formalism to the Boussinesq equations (31.4) and
discard the double derivative after z in the Laplace operators together with the pressure excess p. These
simpliﬁcations lead to the following (Boussinesq–Prandtl) equations for the velocity ﬁeld, v = (vx , 0, vz ),

Example 31.1.3 (Heat radiator): A heat radiator consisting of a single plate of height h = 70 cm
and width L = 1 m is kept at T = 65 ◦ C and placed in a room at T0 = 20 ◦ C. For air we have
˙
Pr = 0.73 and F (0) = −0.388 leading to a total heat ﬂow Q = 235 W from the radiator (including
both sides). The maximal vertical velocity U = max vz is quite naturally found at the top of the radiator,
√
z = h , and inspection of ﬁgure 31.1(a) yields U = maxx vz (x, h) ≈ 0.5 α g0 h ≈ 50 cm s−1 at
s = 1.5 corresponding to a boundary layer width δ ≈ 1 cm. The horizontal Reynolds number becomes
Reδ = U δ/ν ≈ 340, so there should be no turbulence in this boundary layer. The asymptotic horizontal
inﬂow is merely vx |x→∞ ≈ −1 cm s−1 at z = 5 cm above the bottom of the radiator.
Example 31.1.4 (Human heat loss): For a naked grown-up human the skin surface area is A ≈ 2 m2 ,
˙
and standing up the height h ≈ 2 m and L ≈ 1 m. Taking = 10 K we ﬁnd the heat loss Q ≈ 40 W.
Since this is less than half the heat production of 100 W, a human being should easily be able to maintain
a skin temperature of 27 ◦ C in calm air at 17 ◦ C, perhaps even by sweating a little (see example 30.2.5).
As soon as there is even a very gentle wind, the heat loss grows and rapidly begins to chill the body (see
example 30.4.2).

Fluids with horizontal temperature variations, such as the vertical slot discussed above, cannot remain in
hydrostatic equilibrium but must immediately start to convect (see problem 31.1). The situation is, however,
quite different if the ﬂuid is only subject to vertical temperature variations T = T (z). In the following
argument we assume that the ﬂuid is incompressible, so that we do not run into problems with the natural
temperature lapse of the ‘atmospheric’ kind, discussed in section 4.6.
If the ambient vertical temperature rises with height (d T/dz > 0), hydrostatic equilibrium is stable
because a blob of ﬂuid that is quickly displaced upwards will arrive with lower temperature and higher
density than its new surroundings, and thus experience a downwards buoyancy force, tending to bring
it down again. Hydrostatic equilibrium may, however, not be stable if the temperature falls with height
(d T/dz < 0) because a blob that is suddenly displaced upwards into a region of lower temperature will
arrive with lower density than its new surroundings and thus experience an upwards buoyancy force which
tends to drive it further upwards.
Were it not for drag and heat loss, the displaced blob would rise with ever-increasing velocity. Drag
from the surrounding ﬂuid grows with the upwards blob velocity, linearly to begin with. Conductive
heat loss lowers the excess temperature of the blob and thereby its buoyancy. Both of these effects are
proportional to the surface area of the blob whereas buoyancy is proportional to the volume. Consequently,
we expect that large blobs of ﬂuid tend to be more unstable and rise faster than small. This indicates that
there is a critical blob size below which blobs are not capable of rising at all.
In this section we shall estimate the critical blob size, and see that it may be expressed as a critical
Rayleigh number. In the following sections we shall calculate the critical value of the Rayleigh number for
the onset of instability in a horizontal slot.

Stability estimate for spherical blob of ﬂuid
A spherical blob of ﬂuid moving
upwards with constant velocity
U . If the temperature gradient
is negative (d T/dz < 0)
the temperature of the moving
blob will be larger than its
surroundings ( T > 0). The
pressure is assumed to be the
same inside and outside the blob.

For simplicity we begin with an incompressible ﬂuid at rest in constant gravity g0 with a constant negative
vertical temperature gradient, d T/dz = −G, so that the temperature ﬁeld is of the form T (z) = T0 − Gz. A
constant gradient could, as we have seen, be created in a horizontal slot with a ﬁxed temperature difference
between the lower and upper plates.
Imagine now that a spherical blob of ﬂuid with radius a is set into upwards motion with a small
steady velocity U > 0. This is, of course, a thought experiment, and we do not speculate on the
technological difﬁculties in creating and maintaining such a blob. While it slowly rises towards lower
and lower temperatures, the warmer blob will transfer its excess heat to the colder environment over a
typical diffusion time t ∼ a 2 /4κ (see equation (30.17)). In this time the blob rises through the height
z ≈ U t ∼ U a 2 /4κ, and the environment cools by T ∼ G z ∼ GU a 2 /4κ. In the steady state the
competition between the falling temperature of the environment and the loss of heat from the blob should
lead to a time-independent temperature excess of size T , which in turn determines the buoyancy force.
Unfortunately the estimate of T is a bit weak because the P´ clet number Pe = 2aU/κ vanishes in
e
the limit of vanishing U . This implies that for sufﬁciently small U advection of heat will be negligible

compared to diffusion, and that the heat escaping from the blob will spread far beyond the blob radius and
thereby raise the temperature of the environment. The rising sphere thus ﬁnds itself surrounded by a large
‘cocoon’ of ﬂuid (of its own making) that is warmer than the environment and therefore provides smaller
buoyancy than would be the case if the temperature of the environment reigned all the way to the surface of
the sphere. In order to calculate the buoyancy force we must know the temperature distribution inside the
blob relative to the temperature at its surface.
It is most convenient to go to the rest frame of the blob where the ﬂow outside the blob is steady with
the temperature of the environment dropping at a constant rate. The true temperature ﬁeld inside the blob
must then be of the form,
T = T0 − G (z + U t) +

T,

(31.22)

where by assumption the temperature excess ﬁeld T is time-independent. Inside the blob, T must obey
Fourier’s heat equation for at ﬂuid at rest (30.14), which under the given assumptions becomes
−GU = κ∇ 2 T.

(31.23)

Seeking a spherical solution, we ﬁnd T = −(GU/6κ)r 2 + const, and the difference between the
temperature inside the blob and on its surface becomes
δT =

T−

T |r=a =

GU 2
(a − r 2 ).
6κ

(31.24)

This is indeed of the same order of magnitude as the previous estimate T ∼ GU a 2 /κ. The total upwards
buoyancy force is obtained from the density change δρ = −αδTρ0 inside the blob,

Evidently, the buoyancy grows like the ﬁfth power of the radius because its volume grows like the third
power and the diffusion time like the second.
The viscous drag on a solid sphere in slow steady motion is given by Stokes Law (19.12). Disregarding
the internal ﬂow in the blob we estimate that
D = 6πηaU.

(31.26)

This is valid for small Reynolds number Re = 2aU/ν
1, a condition which is always fulﬁlled in the
limit of vanishing U .
If the buoyancy is smaller than the drag, B < D , the sphere cannot continue to rise on its own. In
dimensionless form, the stability condition becomes
B

(31.27)

where ν = η/ρ0 is the kinematic viscosity (momentum diffusivity) of the ﬂuid. Evidently, this inequality
puts an upper limit on the size of stable blobs.

The critical Rayleigh number
In terms of the blob diameter d = 2a, the stability condition (31.27) may be written as a condition on the
Rayleigh number,
g αGd 4
Ra ≡ 0
< 1080.
κν

(31.28)

Tracing back over the preceding calculation, we see that the large critical value Rac = 1080 on the righthand side is mainly due to the ‘cocoon’ of warm ﬂuid carried along with the blob and diminishing its
buoyancy. The critical Rayleigh number for blobs of general globular shape may presumably always be
taken to be around 1000, whereas blobs with radically different shapes, for example long cylinders, will
have quite different critical Rayleigh numbers, although typically they will be large.

Example 31.2.1 (Pot of water): Consider a pot of water with depth h = 10 cm on a warm plate held
at 50◦ C in a room with temperature 20 ◦ C. The temperature difference is ≈ 30 K and the gradient
G = / h = 300 K m−1 . The stability limit for spherical blobs is then obtained from (31.28) and
becomes d 3.7 mm. Convective currents are thus expected to arise spontaneously everywhere in the
pot. If instead there is heavy porridge in the pot with heat properties like water but kinematic viscosity,
say ν ≈ 1 m2 s−1 , the critical diameter becomes d ≈ 12 cm. Such blobs cannot ﬁnd room in the
container, and only a little convection is expected.

º

If the geometry of a ﬂuid container cannot accommodate blobs larger than a certain diameter d, and if
the Rayleigh number for this diameter is below the critical value, the ﬂuid in the container will be stable
with the given negative temperature gradient. The critical Rayleigh number depends, however, strongly on
the geometry of the container, and cannot in general be calculated analytically. In the following section we
shall determine it for the simplest of all geometries, the horizontal slot.

Estimate of terminal blob speed
If the Rayleigh number for a blob is larger than the critical value, Ra > Rac , the blob will accelerate upwards
with larger and larger speed. For large Reynolds numbers, form drag on a sphere, D ≈ (1/4)ρ0 πa 2 U 2
(see page 272), grows quadratically with velocity, and will eventually balance the buoyancy force B . The

terminal speed determined by solving D = B becomes for Ra

(31.29)

where d is the blob diameter. The shape of a rising blob is, however, strongly inﬂuenced by the high speeds,
so this is only a coarse estimate.
Example 31.2.2: In example 31.2.1 a water blob with d = 1 cm will reach a terminal speed of
U ≈ 23 cm s−1 , in reasonable agreement with daily experience.

and size d. The critical surface is
G ∼ d −4 .

The onset of instability in dynamical systems is usually determined by linearizing the dynamical equations
around a particular ‘baseline’ state that may or may not be unstable. The solutions to the linearized
dynamics represent the possible ﬂuctuations around the baseline state, and if no ﬂuctuation can grow
indeﬁnitely with time, the baseline state is said to be stable. The existence of a single run-away ﬂuctuation
mode indicates on the other hand that the baseline state is unstable. In the space of parameters that control
the system, the condition that all ﬂuctuations are damped leads to an inequality like (31.28), which in the
limit of equality deﬁnes a critical surface, separating the stable region in parameter space from the unstable.

Linearized dynamics of ﬂow and heat
In the present case the baseline state is simply an incompressible ﬂuid at rest in hydrodynamic equilibrium
with a vertical temperature distribution of constant negative gradient, T = T0 − Gz. The pressure
must obey the equations of hydrodynamic equilibrium (4.20) on page 50 with the modiﬁed density
ρ = ρ0 (1 − α(T − T0 )) of the heated ﬂuid. Solving the hydrostatic equilibrium equations we ﬁnd
p = p0 − ρ0 g0 z − 1/2ρ0 g0 αGz 2 where p0 is the pressure at z = 0.
A small velocity perturbation v will generate small corrections to the ﬁelds, T and p, so that the

Dissipation does not contribute because it is of second order in v. Adding the buoyancy term −α T g 0 =

quantities,

The advective acceleration is absent because it is of second order in v. Finally the velocity ﬁeld must satisfy
the divergence condition,
∇ · v = 0.

(31.33)

These ﬁve coupled partial linear differential equations should now be solved for the ﬁve ﬂuctuation ﬁelds,
T , p and v, with the appropriate boundary conditions for the particular geometry under study.

Fourier transformation
Fourier transformation is the method of choice for solving homogeneous linear partial differential equations
with constant coefﬁcients. All ﬁelds are assumed to be superpositions of elementary harmonic waves of the
form exp(λt + i k · x) where k is a real wave vector and λ may be a complex number. For a single harmonic
wave, we obtain from the linearized dynamics,

and dotting the second equation with k (using the third), we obtain,

The right-hand side depends on the geometry of the ﬂuid container. If d is the typical length scale for the

For ﬁnite d we multiply both sides by d 4 . The inequality now becomes a condition on the dimensionless

The ﬁnite geometry imposes constraints on the possible wave vectors k on the right-hand side. Among all
the allowed ﬂuctuations, the one that leads to the smallest value of the right-hand side is called the critical
ﬂuctuation, and the corresponding value of the right-hand side is called critical Rayleigh number Rac . It
deﬁnes the upper limit to the convective stability of the baseline state.

Critical ﬂuctuations
When the stability condition (31.38) is fulﬁlled with a non-vanishing right-hand side, all ﬂuctuations
are exponentially damped in time, and the ﬂuid will essentially stay at rest if perturbed slightly. If a
ﬂuctuation violates the stability condition its amplitude will grow exponentially with time, resulting in
more complicated ﬂow patterns, even turbulence, about which linear stability analysis has nothing to say.
Right at the critical point where the inequality becomes an equality the largest of the two stability
exponents (31.36) must vanish, λ = 0. This indicates that the critical ﬂuctuations are time-independent
(for a rigorous proof of this assertion see [37]). In this case it is better to revert to ordinary space where
the critical ﬂuctuations must obey the steady-ﬂow versions of the linearized dynamic equations (31.31)–
(31.33),

and using this equation and (31.39a), vz and

This equation is equivalent to the condition of the vanishing determinant (31.35) for λ = 0, and should be
solved with the boundary conditions for the geometry of the system. Being a kind of eigenvalue equation,
each solution determines a value of the coefﬁcient αGg0 /κν, and the one that yields the smallest value
determines the point where convection ﬁrst begins, i.e. the critical Rayleigh number.
A critical ﬂuctuation is apparently another steady solution to the combined heat and mass ﬂow
problem. It must, however, be kept in mind that an essential assumption behind linear stability
analysis is that the ﬂuctuation amplitudes are inﬁnitesimal so that nonlinear terms can be disregarded.
Nonlinear terms tend in fact to be beneﬁcial and exert a stabilizing inﬂuence on the critical ﬂuctuation
such that it is able to persist somewhat above the critical value without diverging exponentially. This
is why critical ﬂuctuations can be observed at all.

The most conspicuous feature of the heated ﬂuid is that convection breaks the original planar symmetry,
thereby creating characteristic convection patterns. That the symmetry must break is fairly clear, because
it is impossible for all the ﬂuid in the layer to start to rise simultaneously. A localized ﬂuctuation current
which begins to rise will have to veer off into the horizontal direction because of the horizontal boundaries.
We shall see below that at the onset of convection the ﬂow breaks up into an inﬁnite set of ‘rollers’ with
alternating sense of rotation.
Much later, in 1956, it was understood that the beautiful hexagonal surface tessellation observed by
B´ nard in a thin layer of heated whale oil was not caused by buoyancy alone but was driven by the
e
interplay between buoyancy and temperature-dependent surface tension, a phenomenon now called B´ nard–
e
Marangoni convection. Here we shall only discuss clean Rayleigh–B´ nard convection in layers of ﬂuid so
e
thick that the Marangoni effect can be disregarded.

General solution
Let the horizontal layer of incompressible ﬂuid have thickness d and be subject to a constant negative
temperature gradient G. The boundaries are chosen symmetrically at z = ±d/2, for reasons that will
become clear in the following. Since the ﬂow has to veer off at the boundaries, the ﬁelds must depend on
z, implying that k z = 0 in the stability condition (31.38). The wavenumbers k x and k y can in principle
take any real values because of the inﬁnitely extended planar symmetry, but since the right-hand side of the
2
2
stability condition diverges for both k x + k 2 → 0 and k x + k 2 → ∞, the minimum must occur at a ﬁnite
y
y
2 + k 2 . This argument demonstrates that the critical solution must have a periodic horizontal
value of k x
y
structure.
For given k x and k y we may without loss of generality rotate the coordinate system to obtain k y = 0
and k x > 0, implying that the ﬁelds only depend on x and z but not on y. Since there is no geometric
constraint in the x-direction, we are still free to Fourier transform along x, such that the most general form
of the temperature excess takes the form,
T =
where

cos k x x f (z)

(31.42)

is a constant, and f (z) is a (so far unknown) dimensionless function of z. From (31.39a) we ﬁnd

In a given physical context the actual solution depends on the boundary conditions imposed on the
ﬁelds. We shall always assume that the boundaries are perfect conductors of heat such that T = 0 for
z = ±d/2. For the velocity ﬁelds the boundary conditions depend on whether the boundaries are solid
plates or free open surfaces. We shall (as Rayleigh did in 1916) ﬁrst analyse the latter case which is by far
the simplest.

It evidently vanishes for z = ±d/2, and since we trivially have σ yz = 0, both boundaries are completely
free of shear. There is no practical problem in arranging the upper boundary to be shear-free; that is in fact
what we do when we cook. A shear-free lower boundary is on the contrary rather unphysical, so the main
virtue of the shear-free model is that it is easy to solve.

Two solid boundaries
A horizontal slot bounded by two solid plates is easy to set up experimentally. Numerous experiments have
been carried out in the twentieth century and agree very well with the theoretical results [13].
For simplicity we choose the plate distance d = 1 in the following analysis. The fundamental equation
(31.45) is an ordinary sixth-order differential equation with constant coefﬁcients, implying that the solution
is a superposition of exponentials eλz where λ is a root of the sixth-order algebraic equation,

These quantities are all real for 0 < ξ < 1.
The boundary conditions are as before T = 0 together with vx = vz = 0 at z = ±1/2. Since the
boundary conditions as well as the fundamental equation (31.45) are invariant under a change of sign of z,
it follows that the solutions are either symmetric (even) or antisymmetric (odd) in z. In the even case we
have,
f (z) = A cos µ0 z + B cosh µ1 z cos µ2 z + C sinh µ1 z sin µ2 z,

(31.58)

where A, B and C are constants. From the general solution (31.42), (31.43) and (31.44) we see that f (z),
2
f (z), and f (z) − k x f (z) must vanish for z = 1/2.
These conditions provide three homogenous equations for the determination of A, B and C. Such
equations only have a non-trivial solution if their (3 × 3) determinant vanishes. It takes a bit of algebra to
show that the determinant is proportional to,

µ1 = 5.19439 . . .

µ2 = 2.12587 . . . .

(31.61)

Finally, solving the boundary conditions at the critical point, the coefﬁcients become (apart from an overall
factor),
A=1

B = 0.120754 . . .

C = 0.00132946 . . . .

(31.62)

From these values the actual ﬁelds T , vz and vx may be determined. As can be seen from ﬁgure 31.5 the
critical ﬂow pattern consists of an inﬁnity of roughly circular cylindrical rolls, which because of the no-slip
conditions appear to ‘shy away’ from the boundaries.
It should be mentioned that in the antisymmetric case,
f (z) = D sin µ0 z + E cosh µ1 z sin µ2 z + F sinh µ1 z cos µ2 z,

(31.63)

is treated in the same way and leads to a critical Rayleigh number of Rac ≈ 17610.4 . . . which is
uninteresting because it is (much) larger than the even solution.

Solid bottom and free top
This is the situation most often found in the household and industry. Since the boundary conditions are
asymmetric, the solution is a superposition of all six possibilities,
f (z) = A cos µ0 z + B cosh µ1 z cos µ2 z + C sinh µ1 z sin µ2 z
+ D sin µ0 z + E cosh µ1 z sin µ2 z + F sinh µ1 z cos µ2 z.

(31.64)

Although more complicated, the solution is found in the same way as before, and the critical values are
µc = 5.75986 . . . and ξc = 0.775115 . . ., and thus the Rayleigh number is,
Ra = 1100.65 . . . .

(31.65)

This value is probably by accident nearly the same value as the estimate for a rising bubble (31.28). The
wavenumbers for this solution are

Energy balance?
Where does the energy to drive the rolls come from? The steadily rotating ﬂuid could in principle be set to
do useful work, and according to the First Law of Thermodynamics this work must be taken from the heat
ﬂowing between the plates. In effect the plates act as heat reservoirs and the convection as a heat engine
converting heat to work by means of the buoyancy of warm ﬂuid. In the present setup all the work done by
the rotating ﬂuid is actually dissipated back into heat by internal viscous forces, so in the steady state the
energy of the ﬂuid is constant, and no steady inﬂow of heat into the system is required. The local heat ﬂow
through the boundaries will, however, be uneven because of the local variations in the temperature gradient.

Convective pattern formation
The spontaneous formation of convection patterns in otherwise featureless geometries is a common
occurrence. The nonlinear terms which have been left out in the linear approximation will exert a stabilizing
inﬂuence on the patterns such that they are able to persist at Rayleigh numbers somewhat larger than
the critical one. At still larger Rayleigh numbers, the rolls of the critical pattern will develop further
instabilities and eventually turbulent convection may result (for an account of convection patterns with
numerous photographs see [72, 21, 5]).

Turbulence is so commonplace that we hardly notice it in our daily lives. The size of humans and their
speed of locomotion in air or water bring the typical Reynolds numbers into the millions, whether running
or swimming, but most of us never think of the trail of turbulent air we leave in our wake. Our vehicles
move at much higher speeds and generate more turbulence, although great efforts have been made to limit
the extent of the turbulent wake by streamlining cars, airplanes, ships and submarines. In strong winds
the lower part of the atmosphere may become strongly turbulent, but patches of turbulent air can in fact
be found at any altitude, normally in connection with cloud formations, although also in clear air. Most
people have experienced the quite unpleasant buffeting in an airplane exposed to atmospheric turbulence,
particularly at the approach to an airport in heavy weather.
Even under the steadiest of conditions, for example the draining of a large water cistern through a
long open pipe, turbulence will completely ﬁll the pipe when the Reynolds number becomes sufﬁciently
large. The actual road from laminar ﬂow to turbulence as a function of a slowly increasing Reynolds
number is complex and goes through many stages of sometimes intermittent ﬂow patterns, not yet fully
understood. Eventually, at sufﬁciently high Reynolds number, the turbulent ﬂow seems to settle down into
a homogeneous and isotropic state where the small-scale ﬂuctuations in the ﬂow appear to be of the same
nature throughout the pipe, except for a stretch near the entrance and a thin layer very close to the wall.
Such featureless fully developed turbulence is much more amenable to analysis than the ﬂow stages leading
up to it.
In this closing chapter of the book we shall only touch on the most basic and most successful aspects
of turbulence, a subject which for a long time has been and still is an important topic of basic research. The
many modern textbooks on the subject may be consulted to obtain a deeper insight than can be provided
here [6, 71, 72, 40, 25, 39, 61, 58].

32.1 Fully developed turbulence
Turbulence typically appears as a ﬂuctuating velocity component on top of a mainstream ﬂow with high
Reynolds number. In the discussion of the phenomenology of stationary turbulent pipe ﬂow (section 18.5 on
page 255), it was pointed out that when turbulence has become fully developed some distance downstream
from the pipe entrance, it proceeds plug-like down the pipe with a fairly uniform mainstream velocity
distribution across the pipe, apart from a thin layer near the wall where the velocity drops to zero. In the
reference frame of the mainstream ﬂow and at length scales much smaller than the diameter of the pipe, the
bulk of the ﬂuid appears to be in a state of uniform agitation. In the following section we shall estimate the
general statistical properties of this state.

Speciﬁc rate of dissipation
A stationary ﬂow can only be maintained if the environment continually performs work on the ﬂuid to
balance the unavoidable viscous dissipation. In pipe ﬂow the external work is performed by the pressure
drop p maintained between its ends, and if the pipe carries a volume ﬂux Q, the rate of work (power) of
the pressure drop is P = p Q (see page 253). Dividing by the total mass M of the ﬂuid in the pipe, the
speciﬁc rate of dissipation averaged over the whole pipe becomes,

In the last step we have used that M = πa 2 Lρ0 , p = σwall 2L/a and Q = πa 2 U where a is the pipe
radius, σwall the wall stress, and U the average velocity of the ﬂow. The Reynolds number is Re = 2aU/ν
and from the deﬁnition of the dimensionless friction coefﬁcient (18.49) the last expression follows.

In the smooth-pipe turbulent region, 4 × 103
coefﬁcient decreases slowly as Re−1/4 with increasing Reynolds number. Beyond this region, the friction
coefﬁcient becomes constant, although its actual value depends on the roughness of the pipe surface. The
astonishing conclusion following from (32.1) is that the speciﬁc dissipation rate is independent of the
viscosity for sufﬁciently large Reynolds number. Although ultimately caused by viscous friction, the speciﬁc
rate of dissipation is ﬁnite in the limit of vanishing viscosity!

Naive sketch of the energy cascade. A large eddy is thought
to break up into smaller eddies
while conserving both mass and
energy. The break-up stops at the
dissipation scale.

(32.1)

º

Example 32.1.1 (Concrete water pipe): A large concrete pipe with diameter 2a = 1 m carries water
at a discharge rate of Q ≈ 10 m3 s−1 . The average velocity is U ≈ 13 m s−1 , corresponding to a
Reynolds number of Re = 1.3 × 107 well into the rough pipe region. With a roughness scale of 1 mm,
the friction coefﬁcient calculated from (18.51) is C f (∞) ≈ 5 × 10−3 , leading to a speciﬁc dissipation
ε ≈ 21 W kg−1 . Perhaps it does not sound much, but the dissipation rate (per unit of pipe length)
is ρ0 πa 2 ε ≈ 16 kW m−1 , which is about 4000 times larger than it would have been had the ﬂow
remained laminar with a friction coefﬁcient C f ≈ 16/Re ≈ 1.3 × 10−6 .

32.2 The energy cascade
In the model we shall use here the ﬂuctuating velocity component is viewed as composed of fairly localized
ﬂow structures, generically called ‘eddies’, covering a wide range of sizes. The nonlinearity of ﬂuid
mechanics is assumed to transform (‘break up’) the eddies into smaller eddies, while conserving mass
and kinetic energy, until they become so small that they are wiped out by viscous friction, and their energy
dissipated into heat (a picture owed to L. F. Richardson, 1922).
In an isolated patch of turbulence the kinetic energy will in this way be continually sapped ‘from below’
until the turbulence dies away and the ﬂow becomes laminar and in the end will stop completely. We have all
seen this happen after ﬁlling a bucket with water from a wide-open tap. Under steady external conditions
the kinetic energy that is lost to heat will instead be continually re-supplied by the work of the external
forces.

Scaling laws

º º

The energy cascade plays out in an interval of eddy sizes, λd λ L, where the upper cutoff L is related
to the ﬂow geometry (for example the pipe diameter), and the lower cut-off λd represents the dissipation
length scale where viscosity ‘kicks in’. Far above the dissipation cut-off, λ
λd , the eddy dynamics
should be independent of the viscosity, whereas far below the geometry cut-off, λ
L, the actual ﬂow
geometry should not matter for the eddy dynamics.
λ
L, the only parameters that can
In the so-called inertial range satisfying both conditions, λd
be at play in the eddy dynamics are the size λ of an eddy and the time τ it takes for an eddy of this size to
transform into smaller eddies. In the inertial range the magnitude of any other quantity must be related to
these parameters, essentially by dimensional arguments. The ‘break-up’ of an eddy is, for example, bound
to move some ﬂuid a distance of magnitude λ in time τ , leading to an estimate of the velocity variation in
an eddy, u ∼ λ/τ .
The energy-cascade model yields a relation between the time scale τ and the length scale λ by way of
the speciﬁc dissipation rate ε. To see this we focus on a collection of eddies of size λ with total mass d M

and total kinetic energy d Ì ∼ d Mu 2 . In a time interval τ all these eddies break up into smaller eddies,

making the rate of energy turn-over d Ì ∼ d Ì /τ ∼ d Mu 2 /τ . Since both mass and energy are assumed to
be conserved in the cascade that follows, the energy turn-over rate must be the same all the way down to
the smallest scales, and thus in the end nearly equal to the viscous dissipation rate in the original amount of

Since ε has dimension [ε] = W kg−1 = m2 s−3 , one might think that this estimate could have been derived
from a dimensional argument alone, but that would be wrong. The crucial input from the energy-cascade
˙
model is that the terminal rate of dissipation d P may be set equal to the kinetic energy turn-over rate d Ì
for any collection of eddies, independent of their size scale λ.
Solving (32.2) for the time scale, we ﬁnd the λ-dependent result,
τ ∼ ε−1/3 λ2/3 ,

(32.3)

and from this we obtain the velocity scale,
u∼

(32.4)

also known as Kolmogorov’s scaling law.
A basic assumption in the energy-cascade model is that the turbulence is homogeneous and isotropic in
the rest frame of the mainstream ﬂow. Even if ultimately maintained by the work of steady external forces,
the physics in the inertial range only depends on the background velocity U through the speciﬁc dissipation
rate ε, which for pipe ﬂow is given by (32.1). At the scale L of the geometry, it follows from the scaling law
that the velocity of the largest eddies is u L ∼ (εL)1/3 . This is, however, not necessarily the same as the
1/3
mainstream velocity U . Inserting the pipe ﬂow expression (32.1) with a ∼ L, we ﬁnd u L /U ∼ C f . In
example 32.1.1 we have C f = 5 × 10−3 , such that u L in that case is nearly an order of magnitude smaller
than U .

Statistics
The fundamental concept necessary for establishing a statistical model of turbulence is the fraction
d F = d M/M of the total ﬂuid mass (or volume) residing in eddies with sizes in a small interval dλ
around λ. The eddy distribution over sizes, d F/dλ, will in general depend on λ as well as on the system
λ
L, the eddy distribution should only depend
scale L and the viscosity ν, but in the inertial range, λd
on the basic scale parameters, λ and τ . Since d F/dλ has dimension of inverse length, it must be of the
form,

(32.5)

The integral of this distribution diverges for both λ → 0 and λ → ∞. So although this eddy distribution
looks universal, it cannot be properly normalized without introducing a (slowly varying) non-universal
normalization factor depending logarithmically on the limits of the inertial range1 . We shall ignore such
factors here (see, however, problem 32.2).

Energy spectrum
The kinetic energy residing in the eddies with size λ may now be estimated as d Ì ∼ u 2 d M. Using
d M = Md F, and dividing d Ì by Mdλ we obtain the distribution of the speciﬁc kinetic energy according

where u L is the eddy velocity for λ = L. The dependence on the system scale shows that in spite of the fact
that the distribution function (32.6) decreases slowly with wavelength most of the turbulent kinetic energy
resides in the largest eddies near the system scale cut-off, rather than in the small eddies near the dissipation
cut-off.
This is even better seen by expressing the kinetic energy distribution in terms of the inverse length scale,
the ‘wavenumber’ k = 2π/λ. Using dλ ∼ dk/k 2 we obtain the speciﬁc energy spectrum of turbulence as

empirically determined to be about 1.5. Many experiments have conﬁrmed the validity of the Kolmogorov
spectrum in the inertial range, for example the one plotted in ﬁgure 32.12 .

The rate of viscous dissipation is calculated from the velocity gradients in the ﬂow in equation (17.18) on

Solving for λd we arrive at the Kolmogorov dissipation scale,

(32.11)

In practice the inertial scaling laws may be assumed to be valid about an order of magnitude inside inertial
range cut-offs, i.e. for 10λd λ 0.1 L .
At the dissipation scale the corresponding time and velocity scales become,

º º

τd ∼ ε−1/2 ν 1/2 ,

u d ∼ ε1/4 ν 1/4 .

(32.12)

At this scale, everything can be expressed in terms of the speciﬁc rate of dissipation ε and the viscosity ν .
For the pipe ﬂow in example 32.1.1 we ﬁnd λd ∼ 15 µm, τd ∼ 220 µs and u d ∼ 7 cm s−1 . The

geometric scale is L ≈ 1 m, implying that the inertial range should be 1 mm
a factor 100, or two full decades. This illustrates that it may be necessary to go to very large Reynolds
numbers to get three or more decades of length scales in the inertial range. The broadest inertial ranges
have in fact been reached in large natural systems, such as the ocean and the atmosphere (see ﬁgure 32.1).

º º

Eddy viscosity
The random turbulent motion also transfers momentum between adjacent regions of ﬂuid in a way which
resembles molecular momentum diffusion, estimated in equation (17.2). This naturally leads to the idea
that turbulent diffusion at a length scale λ likewise might be described by a kind of effective eddy viscosity
νλ , which in the inertial range is determined by the eddy length and time scales,
νλ ∼

λ2
∼ uλ ∼ ε1/3 λ4/3 .

(32.13)

The eddy viscosity grows monotonically with the size of the eddies and is maximal at the system scale,
ν L ∼ ε1/3 L 1/3 , a value which must also characterize the average eddy viscosity. The smallest eddy
viscosity νλ ∼ ν is obtained for λ ∼ λd , showing that at the dissipation scale momentum diffusion due to
eddies is of the same magnitude as molecular momentum diffusion.

(32.16)

In the pipe ﬂow example 32.1.1 we have Re L ≈ 2.7 × 106 , implying that to simulate the turbulent ﬂow in
the pipe one would have to use at least 3 × 1014 grid points. Even with a computer executing 1012 ﬂoating
point operations per second, it would still take of the order of hours to do a single update of the whole
grid, because each grid point requires quite a few operations. A complete simulation probing all time scales
√
would require at least τ L /τd = Re L ≈ 1600 updates, and might easily take a full year of computation.
Direct numeric simulation of realistic turbulent ﬂows belongs among the hardest computational
problems. Fortunately the need to ﬁnd practical solutions to the technical problems presented by cars,
ships and airplanes have led to a number of more or less ad hoc approximations that yield quite decent
results.

Critique of Kolmogorov’s theory
The derivation of the energy spectrum from scaling considerations depends only on the existence of a
process by which the energy of turbulent motion at a given length scale is continually redistributed over
smaller length scales until it is, in the end, dissipated by viscous forces. The detailed mechanism underlying
this process is not known for sure, although more than 50 years of intense research has produced a
wealth of ideas and results [6, 72, 40, 25, 39]. Numerical simulations have revealed that fully developed
turbulence contains vortex ﬁlaments, and it is believed that stretching of these vortices plays a central role
in transferring the vortex energy to smaller length scales.
Many objections, both mathematical and physical, have been raised against the energy-cascade model
[25]. One physical objection is that fully developed turbulent ﬂow is not as featureless as assumed here,
but is observed experimentally to contain large-scale coherent structures, not included in the Kolmogorov
model [32]. Another is that the Kolmogorov theory fails to take into account the conspicuous intermittency
of turbulence, especially in the unstable regime near the transition from laminar to turbulent ﬂow.
In view of the numerous experimental veriﬁcations of the Kolmogorov energy spectrum, one is,
however, driven to conclude that the law must contain an element of truth, whatever its origin.

32.3 Mean ﬂow and ﬂuctuations
In this section we shall formalize the analysis of turbulence, and for simplicity we continue to assume that
the turbulent ﬂow is driven by steady boundary conditions, necessary for obtaining a statistically stationary
state. In the preceding scaling analysis it was tacitly assumed that the mainstream ﬂow did not inﬂuence the
ﬂuctuating component of the velocity ﬁeld. We shall now see that the ﬂuctuations do in fact exert a decisive
inﬂuence on the mainstream ﬁeld, although mathematically it is fraught with difﬁculties.

Mean values
The mainstream ﬁeld is deﬁned as a suitable average of the true velocity ﬁeld, for example over a large time
interval T starting at any time t,
1 T
v(x, t + s) ds.
T →∞ T 0

v(x, t) = lim

Copyright © 2005 IOP Publishing Ltd.

(32.17)

32.3. MEAN FLOW AND FLUCTUATIONS

505

All other ﬁelds may similarly be averaged over time, for example the pressure,
1 T
p( x, t + s) ds.
T →∞ T 0

p( x, t) = lim

(32.18)

These limits are assumed to exist and be time-independent, although that is by no means a foregone
conclusion. Deﬁned in this way, the mean value of any ﬁeld can in principle be determined experimentally
with any desired precision from the average of a sufﬁciently large number of measurements of the
instantaneous ﬁeld value near the point x over a sufﬁciently long time interval T . The meaning of ‘near’
and ‘sufﬁciently’ depends on the measurement precision, as was discussed in chapter 1.
The ﬂuctuating part of a ﬁeld is deﬁned as the difference between the ﬁeld and its mean value. For the
velocity and pressure ﬁelds we introduce special symbols for the ﬂuctuations,
u( x, t) = v( x, t) − v( x, t) ,

(32.19a)

q(x, t) = p(x, t) − p(x, t) .

(32.19b)

By deﬁnition these ﬂuctuations have vanishing means, u = 0 and q = 0.
As in statistical mechanics, it is often convenient for more formal analysis to replace the time average
of a ﬁeld by the average of the ﬁeld over a suitable statistical ensemble of ﬁelds. That this leads to the
same mean values as time averages is a deep result which we shall not discuss here. In the following
we only assume that there is a well-deﬁned statistical procedure for calculating mean values, denoted by
angular brackets · · · . The system is said to be in statistical equilibrium when all mean values are timeindependent.

Mean ﬁeld equations
Even if quite different from laminar ﬂow, turbulent ﬂow is also assumed to be governed by the usual Navier–
Stokes equations. To avoid cumbersome notation we shall in the following shift the ﬂuctuations out of the
basic ﬁelds, v → v + u and p → p + q, such that the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations become (in
the absence of gravity),
1
∂(v + u)
+ (v + u) · ∇(v + u) = − ∇( p + q) + ν∇ 2 (v + u),
∂t
ρ0
∇ · (v + u) = 0.

(32.20a)
(32.20b)

It must be emphasized that in these equations v and p now denote the mean ﬁelds whereas u and q denote
time-dependent ﬂuctuations with vanishing means. For generality we here also allow the mean ﬁelds to be
time-dependent.
Taking the mean of the second equation and using v = v and u = 0 we get ∇ · v = 0. This
shows that the mean of an incompressible ﬂow is also incompressible, a consequence of the linearity of
the divergence condition. Using this result in (32.20b) it follows in turn that the ﬂuctuation ﬁeld is itself
incompressible, ∇ · u = 0. From the mean of the ﬁrst equation, we get similarly,
1
∂v
+ (v · ∇)v + (u · ∇)u = − ∇ p + ν∇ 2 v.
∂t
ρ0

(32.21)

The last term on the left-hand side stems from the nonlinear advective acceleration, and creates a coupling
between the ﬂuctuations and the mean ﬁelds. Using ∇ · u = 0, it may be rewritten as a tensor divergence,
(u · ∇)ui =

u j ∇ j ui =
j

∇ j (u i u j ),

(32.22)

j

and moving the mean of this term to the right-hand side of (32.21), we arrive at the mean ﬁeld equations
(or Reynolds equations) for turbulent ﬂow,
∂v
1
+ (v · ∇)v = − ∇ p + ν∇ 2 v − ∇ · uu .
∂t
ρ0
∇ · v = 0.

(32.23)

506

32. TURBULENCE
The ﬂuctuation ﬁeld itself satisﬁes an equation which may be derived from the Navier–Stokes equation
(32.20a) by subtracting the ﬁrst mean ﬁeld equation. Rewriting the advective term using (32.22) we obtain
the ﬂuctuation equations,
∂u
1
+ (v · ∇)u + (u · ∇)v + ∇ · (uu − uu ) = − ∇q + ν∇ 2 u,
∂t
ρ0
∇ · u = 0.

(32.24a)
(32.24b)

The split of the ﬁelds into means and ﬂuctuations has thus led to two sets of coupled differential equations
rather than one. They are of course together equivalent to the original Navier–Stokes equations so nothing
has really been gained, except increased complexity!

The closure problem
The mean ﬁeld equations (32.23) would by themselves form a closed system of dynamic equations, if only
we could somehow express the second-order ﬂuctuation moment u i u j in terms of the mean ﬁeld and its
derivatives. Unfortunately, as we shall now see, that is in general not possible.
One might, for example, attempt to determine the second-order moment u i u j from ﬁrst principles by
using the above ﬂuctuation ﬁeld equations (32.24) to calculate ∂(u i u j )/∂t, and afterwards take the mean.
But such a procedure would introduce an unknown third-order moment of the form u i u j u k through the
nonlinear ﬂuctuation term ∇ · (uu) (see problem 32.3 for details). Again one could use (32.24) to get an
equation for the third-order moment, only to ﬁnd that it involves a fourth-order moment, and so on. Even
if in this way an inﬁnite set of equations can in principle be written down for the moments, each equation
will refer to a moment of higher order than the one it is meant to determine. The set of moment equations
does not close.
The closure problem is inherent in the statistical treatment of nonlinear systems of equations, and a large
part of the theoretical studies of turbulence have focused on modelling the moments of the ﬂuctuations to
obtain closure. Sometimes symmetries and dimensional considerations permit general conclusions to be
drawn in simple ﬂow geometries where the symmetry is high and the number of parameters small, but a
fundamental theory of turbulence allowing for effective closure in any geometry is yet to be discovered.

Reynolds stresses
The ﬁrst Reynolds equation takes the same form as the Navier–Stokes equation with an effective stress
tensor,
σi∗ = − p δi j + η(∇i v j + ∇ j vi ) − ρ0 u i u j .
j

(32.25)

The last term was introduced by Reynolds in 1894 and is appropriately called the Reynolds stress tensor.
Apart from the fact that we cannot in general calculate the Reynolds stresses, they appear in the
Reynolds equation for the mean velocity ﬁeld on equal footing with the mean pressure and the mean viscous
stresses. Since the Reynolds equation in analogy with the Navier–Stokes equation may be understood as
expressing local momentum balance, the Reynolds stresses also act as forces by transferring momentum
across internal surfaces cutting through the ﬂuid. The only difference is that the Reynolds stresses must
vanish at solid boundaries due to the no-slip condition for the ﬂuctuations u = 0, and that prevents us from
measuring them directly. There are, however, many ways of measuring the velocity ﬂuctuations over a long
time interval, and from such data the mean values u i u j , as well as the mean value of any other product,
can be obtained.

Velocity defect
It has been mentioned before that in fully developed turbulent ﬂow, the mean velocity does not vary much
across the geometry, except very close to the walls where the no-slip condition has to be fulﬁlled. If U is a
typical mean velocity in the bulk of the turbulent ﬂow, the quantity
v = v − U,

(32.26)

is called the velocity defect. In the bulk of the turbulent ﬂow it is expected to be small, v
U , while it
will be large near a solid wall where the no-slip condition requires v = 0. The magnitude of the velocity

defect therefore determines the magnitude of the velocity gradients, |∇v| ∼ v/ L , in the bulk of the
turbulent ﬂow.
From the Kolmogorov scaling analysis in the preceding section we know that average eddy velocity
must be of the same order of magnitude as the maximal eddy velocity u L such that | uu | ∼ u 2 . The

effective turbulent viscosity νturb can now be estimated from the ratio of the Reynolds stresses to the viscous
stresses,
νturb ∼

L = uL L .

(32.27)

Since the eddy viscosity (32.13) grows rapidly with the eddy scale, the largest eddies will dominate the
turbulent viscosity. Setting νturb ∼ ν L = Lu L in the above estimate we conclude that v ∼ u L .
These arguments support that the velocity defect in the bulk of the turbulent ﬂow is of roughly the same
magnitude as the turbulent velocity ﬂuctuations. In the discussion of simple turbulent ﬂows in sections 32.7
and 32.8 we shall verify this claim.

Effective Reynolds number for turbulence
The condition for turbulent viscosity to dominate over the molecular viscosity is that the Reynolds number
1. There is in fact no turbulence unless
of the system-scale eddies is large, Re L = u L L/ν ∼ νturb /ν
this condition is fulﬁlled.
We are now also in a position to estimate the effective turbulent Reynolds number, deﬁned as the ratio
between the advective mean ﬁeld contribution and the dominant Reynolds stress contribution,
Returb =

where as before Re = U L/ν . In the following we shall see that the right-hand side is not usually very
large, in realistic systems somewhere between 10 and 40. This is comforting, since it would be completely
meaningless if Returb were to become so large that the mean ﬁeld equations became unstable and themselves
developed turbulence!

32.4 Turbulence near a smooth solid wall

y
mainstream ﬂow
δ
outer layer

Turbulent ﬂow along a solid wall appears at ﬁrst sight to be rather uniform and reach all the way to the wall,
but that cannot be completely true. Viscosity demands that the mean velocity ﬁeld as well as the ﬂuctuation
ﬁeld must vanish exactly on the wall. The conﬂict between viscosity’s insistence on a no-slip condition
and turbulence’s tendency to even out mean velocity differences leads to the formation of a two-decked
boundary layer structure. Thus, in any turbulent boundary ﬂow there will be an inner layer which secures
the fulﬁllment of the no-slip condition, and an outer layer that implements the interface to the mainstream
ﬂow. These main layers may be further subdivided into sublayers.
The inner and outer layers must overlap in a ﬁnite region, because in a viscous ﬂow there cannot be a
sharp break anywhere in the true velocity ﬁeld or in any of its derivatives. It is the requirement of a ﬁnite
overlap region that connects the inner and outer layers, and thereby the main ﬂow with the stresses that
the ﬂuid exerts on the wall. It must be emphasized that due to the ﬁnite overlap, there will be no clearly
discernable break between the inner and outer layers. There is, as we shall see, instead a fairly well-deﬁned
transition between the two sublayers of the inner layer.
In the following analysis we shall make the same basic assumptions about the boundary ﬂow as in
the laminar case (chapter 28). The total thickness δ of the boundary layer will always be assumed to be
much smaller than the mainstream geometry scale δ
L. We may then take the wall to be locally ﬂat,
coinciding with the xz-plane, y = 0, in a Cartesian coordinate system. We shall also choose the x-axis
along the mainstream mean ﬂow direction such that vz = 0 throughout the boundary layer. The nonvanishing velocity components vx and v y depend mainly on y, but may change slowly with x (and z) over
the mainstream geometry scale L.

32.5 Inner layer structure
The fundamental dynamic quantity that controls the ﬂow very near the wall is the mean wall shear stress,
σwall = σx y y=0 = η ∇ y vx y=0 ≡ ρ0 u 2 .
0

(32.29)

Here we have for convenience introduced a parameter u 0 , called the friction velocity, and it is also
convenient to deﬁne a third length scale,
δ0 =

ν
,
u0

(32.30)

called the viscous length scale. At this point we do not know what u 0 and δ0 mean, except that given ρ0 and
ν they contain exactly the same information as the wall stress. Like the wall stress they may also change
slowly with x over distances on the mainstream scale L . We shall soon see that u 0 sets the scale for the
velocity and δ0 the scale for the thickness of an extremely thin viscous and nearly laminar inner sublayer
that is always present closest to the wall.
The ratio of inner and outer length scales is an important dimensionless number, called the wall
Reynolds number3 ,
Re0 =

δ
u δ
= 0 .
δ0

(32.31)

It is quite different from the conventional Reynolds number of a boundary layer (see page 411),
Reδ =

ν

(32.32)

where Uδ is the scale of the streamwise velocity at the ‘edge’ of the outer boundary layer y ∼ δ . In turbulent
ﬂows the wall Reynolds number is always large, typically Re0 100, whereas the outer Reynolds number
Reδ typically is between 20 and 40 times larger, i.e. in the thousands.

5, as may be seen in
Empirically, the linear law of the wall is found to be quite accurate for 0 ≤ y/δ0
ﬁgure 32.2. The average velocity in this region is 2.5u 0 , and this demonstrates that the friction velocity u 0
sets the scale of the velocity in the viscous sublayer, and δ0 the scale of its thickness.
Example 32.1.1 (Concrete water pipe, continued): In this example (page 500) the wall stress is
σwall = (1/2)ρ0 U 2 C f ≈ 400 Pa and thus u 0 ≈ 0.6 m s−1 which is only about 5% of the mainstream
ﬂow velocity U = 13 m s−1 . The wall length scale becomes δ0 = 1.6 µm, and taking δ = a = 0.5 m,
we get Re0 = 318 000 for this highly turbulent ﬂow. The viscous length scale is much smaller than the
1 mm roughness scale assumed for concrete and this shows that the idea of a clean viscous sublayer
cannot hold up in this case. Rough walls require a slight modiﬁcation of the theory which will not be
discussed here [61, p. 526].
3 The wall Reynolds number may in the Kolmogorov picture be interpreted as the Reynolds number of the largest

eddies at the edge of the boundary layer, and is often used to characterize experiments and numerical simulations. In the
literature it is also frequently denoted Reτ .

data points are obtained from direct numerical simulation of channel ﬂow by Moser, Kim and Mansour
(see footnote 4 on page 509). The dashed straight line is the velocity in the linear sublayer (32.34), and
the dashed curve is a ﬁt to the velocity in the logarithmic sublayer (32.36) with A = 2.42 and B = 5.42.
The two approximations cross at y/δ0 ≈ 11, indicated by the vertical dotted line. The solid line is the
interpolation (32.46) with A = 2.42, B = 5.57, α = 9.92 × 10−4 and β = 4.02 × 10−4 . One notes that
the ﬁt is not perfect. The imperfections can be seen more clearly in ﬁgure 32.4.

Turbulent logarithmic sublayer
Deeply inside the boundary layer but well beyond the linear region, i.e. for δ0
y
δ, the ﬂow will be
turbulent but because of the proximity of the wall, the wall friction velocity u 0 still sets the velocity scale.
In keeping with the discussion in the preceding sections we expect that the mean velocity slope ∇ y vx in
this region is quite small and essentially independent of the viscosity. It can then only depend on u 0 and y,
and must for dimensional reasons be of the form,
u
∇ y vx = A 0 ,
y

(32.35)

where A is a dimensionless constant. Integrating this expression we obtain the logarithmic law of the wall,
vx

= A log
+ B,
u0
δ0

(32.36)

where B is another dimensionless constant, and where we have normalized the logarithm by the viscous
length scale δ0 = ν/u 0 to make its argument dimensionless. The logarithmic law of the wall goes back to
von Karman and Prandtl in the early 1930s, and the inverse κ = 1/A is called the Karman constant.
30
The received wisdom is that the logarithmic law of the wall is reasonably accurate for y/δ0
with A ≈ 2.4 and B ≈ 5 in all wall-bounded ﬂows. In ﬁgure 32.2 the logarithmic law is compared
with numerical channel ﬂow simulation data4 at Re0 = 590, and a reasonable ﬁt is obtained in the region
y/δ0
100 with A = 2.42 and B = 5.42. In recent years this wisdom has, however, been
30
challenged. Highly precise compressed air pipe ﬂow experiments5 indicate that the strict logarithmic law
ﬁrst sets in for y/δ0 500, and that the constants are A = 2.29 and B = 6.13. In the intermediate region

As discussed above, A and B may change slightly in the region 30 s 500, but for A ≈ 2.5 and B ≈ 5
these expressions cross each other at s ≈ 11. Although we do not know the exact shape of the function in
the crossover region, 5 s 30, this anchoring in the extremes does not leave much liberty for variation
in between. Below we shall present the simplest possible interpolation which connects the two extreme
behaviours.
The mean ﬁeld in the y -direction is determined by the divergence condition ∇x vx + ∇ y v y = 0, and

Reynolds shear stress in the inner layer
In the preceding analysis we have only used dimensional arguments and mass conservation, and completely
ignored the Reynolds equations (32.23) which after all control the dynamics. Since all the x -dependence
in the inner wall layer stems from the wall friction velocity u 0 , any x -derivative must be of magnitude
∇x ∼ 1/ L . Similarly, all y -dependence is governed by δ0 such that ∇ y ∼ 1/δ0 . In the limit of L → ∞ we
may drop all x -derivatives (and therefore also v y ) in the ﬁrst Reynolds equation (32.23), and get

where p0 is the pressure on the wall. The last equation shows that in distinction to the laminar case,
turbulence causes a (small) drop in the pressure as we move away from the wall.
Finally, inserting the mean ﬁeld (32.38) into (32.43a), we get,

(32.44)

The slope f (s) decreases from f = 1 at s = 0 to f = 0 for s = ∞, so for δ0
y
δ the
ﬂuctuation moment is constant u x u y ≈ −u 2 . Due to the negative sign, the ﬂuctuations u x and u y are
0
always statistically anti-correlated, meaning that if u x > 0 then u y < 0, and conversely.
How fast does u x u y vanish in the viscous sublayer? For physical reasons all velocity derivatives must
be ﬁnite at the wall, so that all components of the ﬂuctuation ﬁeld (u x , u y , u z ) must vanish at least as fast
as y. Combined with the divergence condition ∇ · u = ∇x u x + ∇ y u y + ∇z u z = 0, it follows that ∇ y u y ∼ y
and therefore u y ∼ y 2 , whereas u x ∼ y and u z ∼ y. From this we get u x u y ∼ y 3 , and putting in the

of the pipe ﬂow data in ﬁgure 32.3 relative to the linear rise in the viscous sublayer indicates that α might
in fact be negative (if the experimental values can be trusted this close to the wall).

β = 1.43 × 10−3 [61, p. 523]. In ﬁgure 32.2 the precise numerical simulations yield a good ﬁt for
A = 2.42, B = 5.57, α = 9.92 × 10−4 and β = 4.02 × 10−4 . The recent high precision experiments on
pipe ﬂow plotted in ﬁgure 32.3 lead instead to A = 2.29, B = 6.13, α = −0.0189, and β = 0.0214. The
interpolation is in this case very precise for all s and as good as the power law approximation (32.37) in the
region 30 s 500.

In accordance with intuition, the turbulent viscosity in the inner layer thus vanishes rapidly for y → 0 and

32.6 Outer layer structure
Eventually, at a scale set by the boundary layer thickness δ, the logarithmic growth of the mean velocity
ﬁeld vx will come under the inﬂuence of the mainstream ﬂow, causing deviations from the universal inner
law of the wall (32.38). It is for obvious reasons not possible to give a general description of all mainstream
ﬂows, but as long as the boundary layer is thin compared to the mainstream geometry, δ
L, it is possible
to analyse the ﬂow in the outer layer.

δ0 , and since
Since the ﬁrst term ensures that the logarithmic law f = A log(y/δ0 ) + B is fulﬁlled for y
there must be a ﬁnite overlap between the inner and outer layers, the wake function has to vanish for s → 0.
The wake function is assumed to be independent of the viscosity, but may depend on the streamwise
coordinate x, either explicitly or implicitly through the x-dependence of the thickness δ = δ(x) (we
suppress this dependence whenever it is safe to do so).

Friction law
Suppose that we somehow know the velocity vx = Uδ for y = δ. Taking y = δ in (32.51) and using
1 we obtain the so-called friction law (originally due to Prandtl),
Re0 = δ/δ0 = u 0 δ/ν

grows very slowly with Re0 and normally takes values between 20 and 40.

It should be noted that this expression only depends on y/δ and vanishes for y = δ because C = w(1).
The constant B has fallen out here and thus has no inﬂuence on the velocity defect in the whole outer
layer. Different ﬂow geometries only differ in their outer layers, and unless high precision data exist for the
viscous inner layers, it is the velocity defect that is usually compared with experiments.

32.7 Planar turbulent ﬂows
Symmetry and dimensional arguments play an especially important role in the analysis of stationary
turbulence in simple ﬂow geometries where the symmetry is high and the number of parameters small.
In this section we shall apply the theory of turbulent wall ﬂows to model the turbulent ﬂow proﬁle in planar
pressure-driven (channel Poiseuille) ﬂow and velocity-driven (channel Couette) ﬂow. The laminar solutions
for these geometries have previously been obtained in sections 18.2 and 17.2.

β = 4.02× 10−4 . The solid curve is w = C sin2 (π y/d) with C = 1.95. The wiggle on the left corresponds
to the nearly invisible imperfections in the ﬁts of ﬁgures 32.2 and 32.5.
Both planar geometries are inﬁnitely extended along the ﬂow direction and orthogonally to it, so that
formally we may take L = ∞. The inﬁnite longitudinal extent allows us to assume that the outer boundary
layers have expanded to completely ﬁll the interior of the geometry with a turbulent core, smoothly
connecting the outer layer of one wall with that of the opposite wall.

Pressure-driven planar ﬂow
In the planar Poiseuille or channel ﬂow set up both plates are ﬁxed at distance d, and the ﬂuid is driven
between them by a constant pressure gradient. In this case we take δ = d/2, so that the defect velocity
scale equals the maximal ﬂow velocity in the midplane between the plates, Uδ = Umax . We shall soon
relate this velocity to the average velocity between the plates. The two plates are completely equivalent and
must satisfy,
vx (d − y) = vx (y),

(32.55)

because the channel ﬂow set up is symmetric around the midplane.

w = C sin2 (π y/d) for C = 1.95. From the friction law it follows that Umax /u 0 = 21.26, and in view of
the small value of u 0 / Umax ≈ 0.05 the wake function has only about 10% inﬂuence on the velocity proﬁle
in the centre. Small deviations such as the small wiggle close to the wall in ﬁgure 32.4 become essentially
invisible in the velocity proﬁle plotted in ﬁgures 32.2 and 32.5. The wake function exposes in by far the
best way the inadequacy of the wall interpolation function (32.46).
In planar channel ﬂow the controlling parameter is customarily chosen to be the average velocity (rather
than the maximal),

whereas numeric integration yields U/u 0 = 18.67, differing by merely half a per cent.

With w = 0, A = 2.44 and C = 0.56, there is good agreement between (32.66) and older data at Re0 = 733
(extracted from [61, ﬁg. 17.2]). The constant B cannot be determined because of the lack of near-wall data.

Velocity-driven planar ﬂow
In the planar Couette ﬂow set up one plate is ﬁxed at y = 0 and the other moves along the x-axis with
velocity U at a ﬁxed distance y = d. The two plates are completely equivalent in their respective rest
systems, implying that the mean velocity ﬁeld must satisfy the symmetry relation,
vx (d − y) = U − vx (y).

(32.62)

The boundary layer thickness is for symmetry reasons chosen as δ = d/2, making the defect velocity equal
to the central velocity Uδ = U/2.
A wake function representation which respects this symmetry and has the correct near-wall behaviour
at both plates is quite complicated,

The ﬁrst term is identical to the laminar velocity proﬁle and the fourth secures that the no-slip condition is
fulﬁlled at both plates. The wake function is antisymmetric, w(1 − y/d) = −w(y/d), and must vanish in
the centre and the limits, w(0) = w(1/2) = w(1) = 0. The simplest choice is w(s) = 0 for all s.
In this case we cannot obtain the friction law by setting y = δ = d/2, because both sides of the equation
automatically vanish at the centre. The friction law follows instead from the observation that the central
velocity gradient ∇ y vx should be independent of the viscous length δ0 , and that is only possible when the
gradients of the ﬁrst and fourth terms cancel, so that

Zagarola and Smits (see footnote 5 on page 509). The wake function data is calculated using (32.68) with
the parameters determined in ﬁgure 32.3, i.e. A = 2.29, B = 6.13, α = −0.0189, β = 0.0214. The solid
proﬁle is w(s) = C cos2 (π r/2a) with C = 3.07. The ﬁt is excellent, except close to the wall at r = a .
In ﬁgure 32.6 a comparison has been made with older experimental data on the velocity defect at
Re0 = 733 (extracted from [61, ﬁg. 17.2]). With w(s) = 0 a good ﬁt can be obtained for A = 2.44 and
C = 0.56. Since the data does not cover the wall region, the constant B cannot be determined.

32.8 Turbulent pipe ﬂow
In a pipe of radius a, the longitudinal extent of the ﬂow is inﬁnite, whereas the orthogonal extent 2πa is
a, the ﬂat-wall theory should
ﬁnite. Provided the viscous sublayer is much thinner than the radius δ0
also apply to this case. A pipe carrying turbulent ﬂuid looks in the r z-plane very much like planar pressuredriven ﬂow with d = 2a when the coordinate y is replaced by a − r , the velocity vx (y) replaced by vz (r ),
and the range of the r -coordinate is extended to the full interval −a ≤ r ≤ a. As defect scales we choose
the radius, δ = a, and the central velocity Uδ = Umax . We shall impose reﬂection symmetry on the ﬁeld,
vz (−r ) = vz (r ),

(32.67)

to make it continue smoothly across the centerline at r = 0.

The traditional pipe ﬂow Reynolds number Re = 2aU/ν = 2Re0 U/u 0 and friction coefﬁcient C f =

∗ 32.9 Turbulent boundary layer in uniform ﬂow
Boundary layers always arise between a nearly ideal laminar mainstream ﬂow and any solid wall that bounds
it. At sufﬁciently high Reynolds number the ﬂow in a boundary layer inevitably turns turbulent while the
mainstream ﬂow remains laminar and nearly ideal. The turbulent boundary layer thickness is deﬁned by the
transition in the mean velocity from turbulence back to laminar mainstream ﬂow, although this transition is
associated with strong intermittency which we ignore here (see ﬁgure 32.10). We shall also ignore the thin
viscous superlayer in which the ﬁnal transition to the true slip-ﬂow takes place.
In section 28.4 we analysed the beautiful laminar Blasius solution, and in this section we shall extend
the analysis to the turbulent case in the light of our new understanding of the near-wall ﬂow structure.

The analysis goes along the same lines as in the preceding section but turns out to be somewhat more
complicated because of x-dependence.

The uniform ﬂow set up
In the uniform (Blasius) set up a ﬂow v = U e x impinges upon the edge of a semi-inﬁnite plate at zero angle
of incidence. The boundary layer is characterized by three different Reynolds numbers.

(32.76)

The ﬁrst and largest is the traditional mainstream Reynolds number, the second the local Reynolds number,
and the third and smallest the wall Reynolds number.
The friction law (32.52) may be written as a relation,
Reδ = Re0 (A log Re0 + B + C),

(32.77)

between the local Reynolds number and the wall Reynolds number. Traditionally the local friction
coefﬁcient is deﬁned as,
Cf =

(32.78)

and inserting the friction law it also becomes a function of the wall Reynolds number,
Cf =

(A log Re0 + B + C)2

(32.79)

Together (32.77) and (32.79) constitute a parametric representation of the friction coefﬁcient C f as a
function of the local Reynolds number Reδ , basically of the same form as for pipe ﬂow. This function
depends only implicitly on x through the still unknown thickness δ = δ(x). To connect Reδ and C f with
the mainstream Reynolds number Rex we need yet another relation.

Momentum balance
The theory of two-dimensional laminar boundary layers with thickness δ(x) and slip-ﬂow U (x) was
developed in section 28.3. The mean ﬂow in a turbulent boundary layer must likewise satisfy a set of
simpliﬁed boundary layer equations, derived from the Reynolds equations (32.23) by leaving out all xderivatives of the mean ﬁeld and ﬂuctuations in comparison with y-derivatives. Under these conditions we
ﬁnd that the turbulent version of Prandtl’s momentum equation (28.21) on page 414 only differs from the
laminar version by an extra term −∇ y u x u y on the right-hand side.

vertical straight line at Rex = 5 × 105 indicates the transition between the laminar and turbulent regimes,
but the transition is in fact softer than shown here. The fully drawn curve on the right is the numerical
solution of (32.79) and (32.82). The dashed curve that nearly coincides with the fully drawn curve is the

Rex 109 .

The Reynolds stresses are only non-vanishing in the turbulent region of the boundary layer. In the
viscous sublayer as well as in the viscous superlayer interfacing to the slip-ﬂow, we have u x u y = 0.
In deriving the von Karman integral relation (28.35) for the mean ﬂow by integration of the modiﬁed
momentum equation over all y there will, for this reason, be no contribution from the extra term, and the
relation takes in uniform ﬂow in exactly the same form as before,

Here we may cut off the integral at y = δ because vx = U for y δ.
The left-hand side of this equation equals u 2 , whereas the right-hand side is more complicated. To

get an idea about its structure we disregard the viscous sublayer and ignore the wake function by setting
w = C = 0, such that vx = U + u 0 A log(y/δ). The integral is now elementary, and the momentum
equation takes the form

Since u 0 δ = νRe0 , and since the friction law (32.52) for C = 0 yields U/u 0 = f (Re0 ) where
f (s) = A log Re0 + B, the right-hand side depends only on Re0 . Differentiating through Re0 and
introducing Rex = U x/ν in place of x, the above differential equation may be written,
dRex
= A f (Re0 )2 − 2A f (Re0 ) + 2A 2 .

Integrating this over Re0 we obtain the desired relation,
Rex = ARe0 f (Re0 )2 − 4A f (Re0 ) + 6A 2 ,

apart from an undetermined additive constant. From this relation the local Reynolds number (32.77) and
the friction coefﬁcient (32.79) may be determined as functions of Rex . It is, of course, possible to include

32.10 Turbulence modelling
In the preceding sections we have analysed a few systems so simple that their behaviour in the turbulent
regime is severely constrained by symmetry and dimensional arguments. It must be emphasized that
this approach is not fundamental but rather semi-empirical, as witnessed by the appearance of numerical
constants that have to be determined from comparison with data. Some of these constants are justiﬁably
believed to be universal, whereas others depend on the general ﬂow conﬁguration.
Ideally, we would like to calculate these constants from ﬁrst principles. Since we have at hand the
fundamental Navier–Stokes equations governing all Newtonian ﬂuids, it is ‘just’ a question of solving them
for any particular ﬂow geometry. Direct numerical simulation of turbulent ﬂow is indeed possible and
yields believable results with high precision as in the case of channel ﬂow (page 514). Combined with
symmetry and dimensional analysis the numerical constants may in this sense be determined from ﬁrst
principles without any recourse to real experiments. Unfortunately, the hoped-for universality is not perfect
and different numerical and real experiments disagree somewhat on the precise values of the constants.
Theoretically, the closure problem is the real obstacle to solving the Navier–Stokes equations with
turbulence. Barring direct numerical simulation and cheaper variants thereof such as large eddy simulation,
the only way out of this conundrum seems to be to break off the otherwise inﬁnite set of ﬂuctuation
equations, and thereby enforce closure. There are, however, many ways of doing so, and in the last 100
years numerous closure modelling schemes have appeared, sometimes introducing many new adjustable
parameters. It is not the intention here to review this enormous ﬁeld, which is well represented in the
excellent modern textbooks on turbulence [58, 40, 25, 39]

The equations of continuum mechanics are derived by a systematic application of Newton’s laws to systems
that nearly behave as if they consisted of idealized point particles. It is for this reason useful here to
recapitulate the basic mechanics of point particles, and to derive the global laws that so often are found to
be useful.
The global laws state for any collection of point particles that
• the rate of change of momentum equals force
• the rate of change of angular momentum equals the moment of force
• the rate of change of kinetic energy equals power
Even if these laws are not sufﬁcient to determine the dynamics of a physical system, they represent seven
individual constraints on the motion of any system of point particles, independent of how complex it is.
They are equally valid for continuous systems when it is properly taken into account that the number of
particles in a body may change with time.
In the main text a certain familiarity with Newtonian mechanics is assumed throughout. This appendix
only serves as a reminder and as a refresher. It can in no way substitute for a proper course in Newtonian
mechanics.

A.1 Dynamic equations
In Newtonian mechanics, a physical system or body is understood as a collection of a certain number N of
point particles numbered n = 1, 2, . . . , N. Each particle obeys Newton’s second law,
mn

(A.1)

where m n denotes the (constant) mass of the nth particle, x n its instantaneous position, and f n the
instantaneous force acting on the particle. Due to the mutual interactions between the particles, the forces
may depend on the instantaneous positions and velocities of all the particles, including themselves,

A. NEWTONIAN PARTICLE MECHANICS
The forces will in general also depend on parameters describing the external inﬂuences from the system’s
environment, for example the Earth’s gravity. The explicit dependence on t in the last argument of the
force usually derives from such time-dependent external inﬂuences. It is, however, often possible to view
the environment as just another collection of particles and include it in a larger isolated body without any
inﬂuences from the environment.
The dynamics of a collection of particles thus becomes a web of coupled second-order differential
equations in time. In principle, these equations may be solved numerically for all values of t, given initial
positions and velocities for all particles at a deﬁnite instant of time, say t = t0 . Unfortunately, the large
number of molecules in any macroscopic body usually presents an insurmountable obstacle to such an
endeavor. Even for smaller numbers of particles, deterministic chaos may effectively prevent any long-term
numeric integration of the equations of motion.

A.2

Force and momentum

A number of quantities describe the system as a whole. The total mass of the system is deﬁned to be
M=

mn ,

(A.3)

f n.

(A.4)

n

and the total force
=
n

Note that these are true deﬁnitions. Nothing in Newton’s laws tells us that it is physically meaningful to
add masses of different particles, or worse, forces acting on different particles. As shown in problem A.1,
there is no obstacle to making a different deﬁnition of total force.
The choice made here is particularly convenient for particles moving in a constant ﬁeld of gravity,
such as we ﬁnd on the surface of the Earth, because the gravitational force on a particle is directly
proportional to the mass of the particle. With the above deﬁnitions, the total gravitational force, the
weight, becomes proportional to the total mass. This additivity of weights, the observation that a
volume of ﬂour balances an equal volume of ﬂour, independent of how it is subdivided into smaller
volumes, goes back to the dawn of history.
Having made these deﬁnitions, the form of the equations of motion (A.1) tells us that we should also
deﬁne the average of the particle positions weighted by the corresponding masses
xM =

1
mn xn .
M n

(A.5)

For then the equations of motion imply that
M

d2 x M
=
dt 2

.

(A.6)

Formally, this equation is of the same form as Newton’s second law for a single particle, so the centre
of mass moves like a point particle under the inﬂuence of the total force. But before we get completely
carried away, it should be remembered that the total force depends on the positions and velocities of all the
particles, not just on the centre of mass position x M and its velocity d x M /dt. The above equation is in
general not a solvable equation of motion for the centre of mass.
There are, however, important exceptions. The state of a stiff body is characterized by the position
and velocity of its centre of mass, together with the body’s orientation and its rate of change. If
the total force on the body does not depend on the orientation, the above equation truly becomes an
equation of motion for the centre of mass. It is fairly easy to show that for a collection of spherically
symmetric stiff bodies, the gravitational forces can only depend on the positions of the centers of
mass, even if the bodies rotate. It was Newton’s good fortune that planets and stars to a good
approximation behave like point particles.

Like the total force it is a purely kinematic quantity, depending only on the particle velocities, calculated

that the total momentum obeys the equation

Again it should be noted that this equation cannot be taken as an equation of motion, except in very special
circumstances. It should rather be viewed as a constraint (or rather three since it is a vector equation) that
follows from the true equations of motion, independent of what form the forces take. This constraint is
particularly useful if the total momentum is known to be constant, or equivalently the centre of mass has
constant velocity, because then the total force must vanish.

A.3 Moment of force and angular momentum
Similarly, the total moment of force acting on the system is deﬁned as

Å=

xn × f n .

(A.9)

Like the total force, it is a dynamic quantity calculated from the sum of the individual moments of force
acting on the particles.
The corresponding kinematic quantity is the total angular momentum,

The ﬁrst term in parenthesis vanishes because the cross product of a vector with itself always vanishes, and
using the equations of motion in the second term, we obtain

Ä Å.

d
=
dt

(A.11)

Like the equation for total momentum and total force, (A.8), this equation is also a constraint that must be
fulﬁlled, independent of the nature of the forces acting on the particles. Angular momentum has to do with
the state of rotation of the body as a whole. If the total angular momentum is known to be constant, as for a
non-rotating body, the total moment of force must vanish. This is also what lies behind the lever principle.
From the earliest times levers have been used to lift and move heavy weights, such as the stones
found in stone-age monuments. A primitive lever is simply a long stick with one end wedged under
a heavy stone. Applying a small ‘man-sized’ force orthogonal to the other end of the stick, the
product of the long arm and the small force translates into a much larger force at the end of the small
arm wedged under the stone. The total moment vanishes, when the stick is not moving.
The moment of force and the angular momentum both depend explicitly on the choice of origin of the
coordinate system. These quantities might as well have been calculated around any other ﬁxed point c,
leading to

Å(c) =

This shows that if the total force vanishes, the total moment of force becomes independent of the choice of

the choice of origin.

of action for gravity, or as it is usually called, the centre of gravity.

the forces acting on all the particles making up a body is

(A.16)

The rate of change of the kinetic energy equals the power.

A.5

Internal and external forces

The force acting on a particle may often be split into an internal part due to the other particles in the system
and an external part due to the system’s environment,
f n = f int + f ext .
n
n

(A.17)

The internal forces, in particular gravitational forces, are often two-particle forces with f n,n denoting the
force that particle n exerts on particle n. The total internal force on particle n thus becomes
f int =
n

f n,n .

(A.18)

n

Most two-particle forces also obey Newton’s third law, which states that the force from n on n is equal and
opposite to the force from n on n ,
f n,n = − f n ,n .

(A.19)

Although the external forces may themselves stem from two-particle forces of this kind, this is ignored as
long as the nature of the environment is unknown.
Strong theorems follow from the above assumptions about the form of the internal forces. The ﬁrst is
that the total internal force vanishes,
int =

f int =

showing that it is sufﬁcient to know the total external force acting on a system in order to calculate its
rate of change of momentum. The details of the internal forces can be ignored as long as they are of the
two-particle kind and obey Newton’s third law.
Under the same assumptions, the internal moment of force becomes

Å=

This does not in general vanish, except for the case of central forces where
f n,n ∼ x n − x n .

Gravitational forces (and others) are of this type. Provided the internal forces stem from central two-particle
forces, the total moment of force equals the external moment, such that

Ä Åext .

(A.24)

This rule is, however, not on nearly the same sure footing as the corresponding equation for the momentum
rate (A.21).
Finally, there is not much to be said about the kinetic energy rate (A.16), which in general has nonvanishing internal and external contributions.

A.6 Hierarchies of particle interactions
Under what circumstances can a collection of point particles be viewed as a point particle? The dynamics
of the solar system may to a good approximation be described by a system of interacting point particles,
although the planets and the Sun are in no way pointlike in our own scale. In the scale of the whole universe,
even galaxies are sometimes treated as point particles.
A point particle approximation may be in place as long as the internal cohesive forces that keep the
interacting bodies together are much stronger than the external forces. In addition to mass and momentum,
such a point particle may also have to be endowed with an intrinsic angular momentum (spin), and
an intrinsic energy. The material world appears in this way as a hierarchy of approximately point-like
interacting particles, from atoms to galaxies, at each level behaving as if they had no detailed internal
structure. Corrections to the ideal point-likeness can later be applied to add more detail to this overall
picture. Over the centuries this extremely reductionist method has shown itself to be very fruitful, but it is
an open (scientiﬁc) question whether it can continue indeﬁnitely.

Problems
A.1 Try to deﬁne the total force as
= n m n f n rather than (A.4), and investigate what this entails
for the global properties of a system. Can you build consistent mechanics on this deﬁnition?
A.2 Show that the total momentum is È = Md x M /dt where x M is the centre of mass position.

The distance between two points in Euclidean space takes the simplest form in Cartesian coordinates. The
geometry of concrete physical problems may, however, make non-Cartesian coordinates more suitable as
a basis for analysis, even if the distance becomes more complicated in the new coordinates. Since the
new coordinates are nonlinear functions of the Cartesian coordinates, they deﬁne three sets of intersecting
curves, and are for this reason called curvilinear coordinates.
At a deeper level, it is often the symmetry of a physical problem that points to the most convenient
choice of coordinates. Cartesian coordinates are well suited to problems with translational invariance,
cylindrical coordinates for problems that are invariant under rotations around a ﬁxed axis, and spherical
coordinates for problems that are invariant or partially invariant under arbitrary rotations. Elliptic and
hyperbolic coordinates are also of importance but will not be discussed here (see [7, p. 455]).

As may be directly veriﬁed, they are orthogonal and normalized everywhere, and thus deﬁne a local
curvilinear basis with an orientation that changes from place to place. An arbitrary vector ﬁeld may
therefore be resolved in this basis

where the vector coordinates
Vr = V · er ,

Vφ = V · eφ ,

The treatment of spherical coordinates follows much the same pattern as cylindrical coordinates. Spherical
or polar coordinates consist of the radial distance r , the polar angle θ and the azimuthal angle φ. If the
z-axis is chosen as the polar axis and the x-axis as the origin for the azimuthal angle, the transformation
from spherical to Cartesian coordinates becomes,
x = r sin θ cos φ,

(B.10a)

y = r sin θ sin φ,

(B.10b)

(B.10c)

The domain of variation for the spherical coordinates is 0 ≤ r < ∞, 0 ≤ θ ≤ π and 0 ≤ φ < 2π.

An ideal gas is a nice ‘laboratory’ for understanding the thermodynamics of a ﬂuid with a non-trivial
equation of state. In this section we shall recapitulate the conventional thermodynamics of an ideal gas with
constant heat capacity. For more extensive treatments, see for example [35, 12].

C.1 Internal energy
In section 4.1 we analysed Bernoulli’s model of a gas consisting of essentially non-interacting point-like
molecules, and found the pressure p = (1/3)ρ v 2 where v is the root-mean-square average molecular
speed. Using the ideal gas law (4.26) the total molecular kinetic energy contained in an amount M = ρV
of the gas becomes,
1 Mv 2 = 3 pV = 3 n RT,
2
2
2

(C.1)

where n = M/Mmol is the number of moles in the gas. The derivation in section 4.1 shows that the factor
3 stems from the three independent translational degrees of freedom available to point-like molecules. The
above formula thus expresses that in a mole of a gas there is an internal kinetic energy (1/2)RT associated
with each translational degree of freedom of the point-like molecules.
Whereas monatomic gases like argon have spherical molecules and thus only three translational degrees
of freedom, diatomic gases like nitrogen and oxygen have stick-like molecules with two extra rotational
degrees of freedom orthogonal to the bridge connecting the atoms, and multiatomic gases like carbon
dioxide and methane have three extra rotational degrees of freedom. According to the equipartition theorem
of statistical mechanics these degrees of freedom will also carry a kinetic energy (1/2)RT per mole.
Molecules also possess vibrational degrees of freedom that may become excited at high temperatures, but
we shall disregard them here.
The internal energy of n moles of an ideal gas is deﬁned to be,

Í = k n RT,
2

(C.2)

where k is the number of molecular degrees of freedom. A general result of thermodynamics (Helmholtz’
theorem [35, p. 154]) guarantees that for an ideal gas Í cannot depend on the volume but only on the
temperature. Physically a gas may dissociate or even ionize when heated, and thereby change its value of k,
but we shall for simplicity assume that k is in fact constant with k = 3 for monatomic, k = 5 for diatomic

C. THERMODYNAMICS OF IDEAL GASES
and k = 6 for multiatomic gases. For mixtures of gases the number of degrees of freedom is the molar
average of the degrees of freedom of the pure components (see problem C.1).

C.2

Heat capacity

Suppose that we raise the temperature of the gas by δT without changing its volume. Since no work is
performed, and since energy is conserved, the necessary amount of heat is δ Q = δ Í = C V δT where the
constant,
k
n R,
(C.3)
2
is naturally called the heat capacity at constant volume.
If instead the pressure of the gas is kept constant while the temperature is raised by δT , we must
also take into account that the volume expands by a certain amount δV and thereby performs work on its
surroundings. The necessary amount of heat is now larger by this work, δ Q = δU + pδV . Using the ideal
gas law (4.26) we have for constant pressure pδV = δ( pV ) = n RδT . Consequently, the amount of heat
which must be added per unit of increase in temperature at constant pressure is
CV =

C p = C V + n R,

(C.4)

called the heat capacity at constant pressure. It is always larger than C V because it includes the work of
expansion.

The adiabatic index
The dimensionless ratio of the heat capacities,
γ =

Cp
2
=1+ ,
CV
k

(C.5)

is for reasons that will become clear in the following called the adiabatic index. It is customary to express
the heat capacities in terms of γ rather than k,
CV =

1
n R,
γ −1

Cp =

γ
n R.
γ −1

(C.6)

Given the adiabatic index, all thermodynamic quantities for n moles of an ideal gas are completely
determined. The value of the adiabatic index is γ = 5/3 for monatomic gases, γ = 7/5 for diatomic
gases and γ = 4/3 for multiatomic gases.

C.3

Entropy

When neither the volume nor the pressure are kept constant, the heat that must be added to the system in an
inﬁnitesimal process is,
δV
.
(C.7)
V
It is a mathematical fact that there exists no function, Q(T, V ), which has this expression as differential
(see problem C.2). It may on the other hand be directly veriﬁed (by insertion) that
δ Q = δU + pδV = C V δT + n RT

δË =

δT
δQ
δV
= CV
+ nR
,
T
T
V

(C.8)

can be integrated to yield a function,

Ë = C V log T + n R log V + const.

(C.9)

called the entropy of the amount of ideal gas. Being an integral the entropy is only deﬁned up to an arbitrary
constant. The entropy of the gas is, like its energy, an abstract quantity which cannot be directly measured.
But since both quantities depend on the measurable thermodynamic quantities, ρ, p and T , that characterize
the state of the gas, we can calculate the value of energy and entropy in any state. But why bother to do so?

C.3. ENTROPY

537

The two fundamental laws of thermodynamics
The reason is that the two fundamental laws of thermodynamics are formulated in terms of the energy and
the entropy. Both laws concern processes that may take place in an isolated system which is not allowed to
exchange heat with or perform work on the environment.
The First Law states that the energy is unchanged under any process in an isolated system. This implies
that the energy of an open system can only change by exchange of heat or work with the environment. We
actually use this law implicitly in deriving heat capacities and entropy.
The Second Law states that the entropy cannot decrease. In the real world, the entropy of an isolated
system must in fact grow. Only if all the processes taking place in the system are completely reversible at all
times, will the entropy stay constant. Reversibility is an ideal which can only be approached by very slow
quasi-static processes, consisting of inﬁnitely many inﬁnitesimal reversible steps. Essentially all real-world
processes are irreversible to some degree.
Example C.3.1 (Joule’s expansion experiment): An isolated box of volume V contains an ideal gas
in a walled-off compartment of volume V0 . When the wall is opened, the gas expands into vacuum and
ﬁlls the full volume V . The box is completely isolated from the environment, and since the internal
energy only depends on the temperature, it follows from the First Law that the temperature must be the
same before and after the event. The change in entropy then becomes

Ë = (C V log T + n R log V ) − (C V log T + n R log V0 ) = n R log(V /V0 )
which is evidently positive (because V /V0 > 1). This result agrees with the Second Law, which thus
appears to be unnecessary.
The strength of the Second Law becomes apparent when we ask the question of whether the air in
the box could ever—perhaps by an unknown process to be discovered in the far future—by itself enter
the compartment of volume V0 , leaving vacuum in the box around it. Since such an event would entail
a negative change in entropy which is forbidden by the Second Law, it never happens.

Isentropic processes
Any process in an open system which does not exchange heat with the environment is said to be adiabatic.
If the process is furthermore reversible, it follows that δ Q = 0 in each inﬁnitesimal step, so that
δ Ë = δ Q/T = 0. The entropy (C.9) must in other words stay constant in any reversible, adiabatic process.
Such a process is for this reason called isentropic.
By means of the adiabatic index (C.5) we may write the entropy (C.9) as,

Ë = C V log

T V γ −1 + const.

(C.10)

From this it follows that
T V γ −1 = const,

(C.11)

for any isentropic process in an ideal gas. Using the ideal gas law to eliminate V ∼ T/ p, this may be
written equivalently as,
T γ p1−γ = const.

(C.12)

Eliminating instead T ∼ pV , the isentropic condition takes its most common form,
p V γ = const.

(C.13)

Note that the constants are different in these three equations.
Example C.3.2: When the air in a bicycle pump is compressed from V0 to V1 (while you block the
γ
γ
valve with your ﬁnger), the adiabatic law implies that p1 V1 = p0 V0 . For p0 = 1 atm and V1 = V0 /2
we ﬁnd p1 = 2.6 atm. The temperature simultaneously rises about 100 degrees, but the hot air quickly
becomes cold again during the backstroke. One may wonder why the fairly rapid compression stroke
may be assumed to be reversible, but as long as the speed of the piston is much smaller than the velocity
of sound, this is in fact a reasonable assumption. Conversely, we may conclude that the air expands
with a velocity close to the speed of sound when the wall is opened in example C.3.1.

C. THERMODYNAMICS OF IDEAL GASES

Isothermal versus isentropic bulk modulus
The bulk modulus of a strictly isothermal ideal gas with p = ρ RT0 / Mmol is equal to the pressure,
KT = ρ

∂p
= p.
∂ρ T

(C.14)

Here the index T (in the usual thermodynamic way of writing derivatives) signals that the temperature must
be held constant while we differentiate.
In terms of the mass density ρ = M/ V , the isentropic condition may be written in any of three different
ways (with three different constants),
p ρ −γ = const,

T γ p1−γ = const.

Tρ 1−γ = const,

(C.15)

Using the ﬁrst we ﬁnd the isentropic bulk modulus of an ideal gas,
KS = ρ

∂p
∂ρ

Ë

= γ p,

(C.16)

where the index S now signals that the entropy must be held constant. The distinction between the
isothermal and isentropic bulk modulus is necessary in all materials, but for nearly incompressible liquids
there is not a great difference between K S and K T .
Among Isaac Newton’s great achievements was the ﬁrst calculation of the speed of sound in air,
using the ideal gas law with constant temperature. His result did not agree with experiment, because
normal sound waves oscillate so rapidly that compression and expansion are essentially isentropic
√
processes. In section 16.2 we ﬁnd that the speed of sound is c = K /ρ , such that the ratio between
√
the isentropic and isothermal sound velocities is cË /cT = γ . For air with γ ≈ 1.4 this amounts
to an 18% error in the sound velocity. Much later, in 1799, Laplace derived the correct value for the
speed of sound.

C.4

Speciﬁc quantities

In classical thermodynamics we always think of a macroscopic volume of matter with the same
thermodynamic properties throughout the volume. Volume, mass, energy, entropy and the speciﬁc heats
are all extensive quantities, meaning that the amount of any such quantity in a composite system is the
sum of the amounts in the parts. Pressure, temperature and density are in contrast intensive quantities, that
cannot be added when a system is put together from its parts.
In continuum physics, an intensive quantity becomes a ﬁeld that may vary from place to place, whereas
an extensive quantity becomes an integral over the density of the quantity. Since a material particle with
a ﬁxed number of molecules has a ﬁxed mass (subject to the reservations set down in chapter 1), the
natural ﬁeld to introduce to describe an extensive quantity like the energy is the speciﬁc internal energy,
u = d Í /d M, which is the amount of energy per unit of mass in the neighbourhood of a given point. The
actual energy density becomes d Í /d V = ρ u, and the total energy in a volume

Í=

V

ρ u d V.

(C.17)

The speciﬁc energy is an intensive quantity like temperature, pressure or density.
Similarly, we deﬁne the speciﬁc heat as the local heat capacity per unit of mass. Since the heat capacities
(C.6) of an ideal gas are directly proportional to the mass M = n Mmol , the speciﬁc heats of an ideal gas
become,
cV =

1
R
,
γ − 1 Mmol

cp =

γ
R
.
γ − 1 Mmol

(C.18)

They are constants which only depend on the properties of the gas. For air we have cV = 718 J K−1 kg−1
and c p = 1005 J K−1 kg−1 . From (C.2) we obtain after dividing by M,
u = cV T.

(C.19)

PROBLEMS

539

The speciﬁc energy of an ideal gas is the speciﬁc heat times the absolute temperature.
Finally, we deﬁne the speciﬁc entropy, s = d Ë /d M, from which the total entropy may be calculated as
an integral,

Ë=

V

ρ s d V.

(C.20)

For an ideal gas, the speciﬁc entropy is obtained by dividing (C.10) by M = n Mmol . It may be written in
three different forms related by the ideal gas law,
s = cV log Tρ 1−γ + const

(C.21a)

= cV log T γ p1−γ + const

(C.21b)

= cV log p ρ −γ + const.

(C.21c)

Note, however, that the constants are different in the three cases.

and x-axis towards Greenwich at longitude α = 0 we have x = (a + h) cos α cos δ, y = (a + h) sin α cos δ,
and z = (a + h) sin δ where a is the sea-level radius of the Earth. Using the invariance of the distance the
square of the distance function becomes d 2 = (x1 − x2 )2 + (y1 − y2 )2 + (z 1 − z 2 )2 which may be recast
into d 2 = (a + h 1 )2 + (a + h 2 )2 − 2(a + h 1 )(a + h 2 )(cos δ1 cos δ2 cos(α1 − α2 ) + sin δ1 sin δ2 ).

and the inequality follows.

2.10 Assume ﬁrst that the vectors a, b and c are linearly independent. In that case the cross products on
the right-hand side will also be linearly independent, so that d can be written as a linear combination of
these cross products. Check that coefﬁcients are given by the dot products of d with a, b and c. Finally,
one must discuss the cases where a, b og c are linearly dependent.

kl aik Tkl =

of the transformation matrix, Ti j = kl aik a j l Tkl , which proves that T is a tensor.

1
A
A (x) = {ai j (x)} and ai j = ∂ fi /∂ x j . Differentiate again after y to obtain −1 = −A ( y) · A (x). This
means that A (x) −1 = A( y) . The left-hand side depends only on x and the right-hand side only on y
which implies that both sides are independent of x and y, i.e. the matrix A is a constant, and orthogonal.
Integrating ai j = ∂ f i /∂ x j one gets f (x) = A · x + b.
2.22 Let A z (φ) be the matrix of the simple rotation (2.36) through an angle φ around the z-axis. Then
the three Euler angles φ, θ and ψ determine any rotation matrix as a product A = A z (ψ) · A y (θ) · A z (φ).

3.3 Earth’s true rotation period T = T0 ∗ 365/366 is a bit shorter than T0 = 24 hours because the orbital

(b) The origin of coordinates is again chosen at the peak of the cone. The area function is now −A(z)
in the interval −h < z < 0. The parameter d is for convenience chosen to be the ‘antidraught’
such that the true draught is h − d. The total volume is again V = Lh 2 tan α, and the centre of
gravity z G = − 2 h. The submerged volume is V0 = L(h 2 − d 2 ) tan α and the centre of buoyancy
3
z B = − 2 (h 3 − d 3 )/(h 2 − d 2 ). The waterline integral is the same as before, and the metacentric
3
height z M = − 2 (h 3 − d 3 / cos2 α)/(h 2 − d 2 ). The stability condition becomes again d/ h > cos2 α
3
but since ρ1 /ρ0 = V0 /V = 1 − (d/ h)2 the density condition becomes ρ1 /ρ0 < 1 − cos4 α.
(c) Combining the two conditions we get cos4 α < ρ1 /ρ0 < 1 − cos4 α. This is only possible for
cos α < 2−1/4 or α > 33 ◦ .

5.5 Using the same method as in problem 5.4 we ﬁnd (a) ρ1 /ρ0 > cos6 α, (b) ρ1 /ρ0 < 1 − cos6 α, and

(c) α > 27 ◦ .

H =

proves the claim. (b) On the surface of a spherical body we have

the density ρ(z) falls with increasing z, p will be smaller on the top of the sphere than on the bottom, and
thus increase the buoyancy force.

Since the force is constant the braking distance is d0 = Ì /

9.4 The pressure at the bottom in the middle of the mountain where it is highest is p ≈ ρg0 h where h is

(a) The body starts to move when the elastic force equals the maximal static friction, that is for
ks = µ0 mg0 or s = µ0 mg0 /k.

The minimum stretch is s1 = r s −v/ω cos α = s(r −(1−r )/ sin α) at t = t1 where ωt1 +α = 3π/2.
For the minimum stretch to be positive, one must require that r > (1 − r )/ sin α, and since sin α < 1
this inequality can only be fulﬁlled for r > 1 − r or r > 1/2. Notice that ω(t1 − t0 ) = α − π/2 and
α < π/2, so that the minimum always happens before the block stops.
(f) When the block stops at t = t0 the stretch is s0 = s(2r − 1). The stretch grows to s0 + v t
a time t after the body stops. The body starts to move again when the stretch becomes s, or
v t = s − s0 = 2(1 − r )s, which is positive as expected. The circular frequency of the jumping

10.8 We must solve
∇ x u x = ∇ y u y = ∇z u z = 0
∇ y u z + ∇z u y = ∇z u x + ∇z u z = ∇x u y + ∇ y u x = 0.
From the ﬁrst we get that u x can only depend on y and z, and for the second derivatives we get

∇ y u x = −∇ y ∇x u y = −∇x ∇ y u y = 0
2
∇z u x = −∇z ∇x u z = −∇x ∇z u z = 0

∇ y ∇z u x = −∇ y ∇x u z = −∇x ∇ y u z = ∇x ∇z u y = ∇z ∇x u y = −∇z ∇ y u x .
From the last equation we get ∇ y ∇z u x = 0. Consequently, we must have u x = A + Dy + E z and similar
results for u y and u z . The vanishing of the shear strains relates some of the constants.

11.4 Assuming that there is no transverse or shear deformation, and taking the x-axis along the beam
axis, the only component of strain is u x x . Inserting this into (11.9) one gets σx x = (2µ + λ)u x x = P and
σ yy = σzz = λu x x = λP/(2µ + λ). The displacement ﬁeld is u = x P/(2µ + λ) and u y = u z = 0. Since
it satisﬁes the equilibrium equation and the boundary conditions, it is the right solution.
11.5 The boundary conditions are fulﬁlled with the constant values σx x = P, u yy = 0, and σzz = 0.
Inserting this into (11.18b) we get σ yy = ν P, and using (11.18a,c) we get u x x = (1 − ν 2 )P/E, and
u zz = −ν(1 + ν)P/E. The displacement ﬁeld becomes u x = xu x x and u z = zu zz . Since it satisﬁes the
boundary conditions and the equilibrium equations, it is the right solution.

(b) The equilibrium equations become,
∇x σx x + ∇ y σx y = 0,

∇x σ yx + ∇ y σ yy = 0.

Eu x y = (1 + ν)σx y = −(1 + ν)∇x ∇ y φ,

(11.A9)

(11.A8)

The equation now follows by insertion into (11.35).
(e) The equations to be solved are,
u x x = 2x,

u yy = −2νx,

u zz = −2νx,

(11.A10)

u x y = −2(1 + ν)y,

u x z = 0,

u yz = 0.

(11.A11)

First the diagonal elements are solved on their own,
ux = x 2,

u y = −2νx y,

u z = −2νxz.

(11.A12)

Here u yz = 0 automatically. To fulﬁll u x z = 0 an extra term is necessary in u x , so that
u x = x 2 + νz 2 ,

u y = −2νx y,

u z = −2νxz,

(11.A13)

Finally add another term to u x to obtain the correct expression for u x y ,
u x = x 2 + νz 2 − (2 + ν)y 2 ,

u y = −2νx y,

u z = −2νxz,

(11.A14)

To this may be added an arbitrary solid translation or rotation.

11.7 The absolute minimum of the coefﬁcient of the ﬁrst term happens for α = 1/3.

The tensile strength of steel is 5500 bar. Since u φφ is just above this value, the barrel may blow up.

12.4 We use that u zz is linear in x and y, of the form
u zz = ∇z u z = α − βx x − β y y
and consequently
u z = az − φ y x + φx y + αz − βx xz − β y yz
where the coefﬁcients are all constants. Using this result, we ﬁnd ∇x u x = ∇ y u y = −ν(α − βx x − β y y).
Integrating and demanding that u x y = u x z = u zy = 0, we obtain the most general form

u x = ax − φz y + φ y z − ανx + βx (z 2 − ν(x 2 − y 2 )) − β y νx y,

u y = a y + φz x − φx z − ανy + β y (z 2 − ν(y 2 − x 2 )) − βx νx y,

µ κT A = −µκT A.

(14.A6)

In view of κT and κT being positive these equations do not have a solution. Thus, there are no interface
waves of this kind. At a free surface, we would instead have A = 0, but can only require σ yz = 0 which
leads to A = 0.

energy which is real and positive deﬁnite. Hence ω2 is real and positive.

This ﬁeld has no curl and no divergence, ∇ × F = 0, ∇ · F = 0. From the double-cross rule (2.67)
it must satisfy ∇ 2 F = 0. Determine a ﬁeld G satisfying ρ∂ 2 G/∂ 2 t = F together with ∇ × G = 0 and
∇ · G = 0. Such a ﬁeld can always be found by integrating F twice over time. Then deﬁne new longitudinal
and transverse ﬁelds
u L = u L − G,

u T = uT + G.

(14.A13)

These ﬁelds also have ∇ × u L = 0 and ∇ · u T = 0, satisfy (14.2) and yield the same solution as the others:
u = u L + uT = u L + u T .

15.3 Leonardo’s law tells us that Av = A1 v1 + A2 v2 . The ratio of the rates in the two pipes is

A 1 v1 /A 2 v2 = 2, and since A 1 /A 2 = 9/4 we get v1 /v2 = 8/9. The total rate is Av = 3A 2 v2 so that

ANSWERS TO PROBLEMS
18.3 Let the pressure gradient be G along the x-direction and the relative plate velocity U along the zdirection. Assume that the ﬁeld is of the form v = (vx (y), 0, vz (y)). Then the Navier–Stokes equations
imply that p and vx are identical to the planar pressure driven ﬂow, whereas vz is identical to the velocity
driven ﬂow.

18.4 If pressure were used to drive the planar sheet, there would have to be a linearly falling pressure
along the open surface. But that is impossible because the open surface requires constant pressure.
18.5 Using the same method as in section 18.3 we ﬁnd in the two layers the equations,
∇ y p = −ρ1 g0 cos θ,

∇z p = 0,

(18.A2)

∇ y p = −ρ2 g0 cos θ,

∇z p = 0.

18.9 (a) The simplest way is to recognize that the mass dimension (kg) contained in ρ and η can only be
removed by forming the ratio ν = η/ρ of dimension m2 s−1 . Since Q has dimension of m3 s−1 , the time
unit can only be removed by forming the ratio Q/ν which has dimension of m. Finally, dividing by a, we
get the dimensionless number Q/νa which is proportional to the Reynolds number. (b) Since the dimension
of the pressure gradient is [G] = Pa m−1 = kg s−2 m−2 we get rid of the mass dimension by dividing
by the mass density to get [G/ρ] = m s−2 . Then [G/ρν 2 ] = m−3 and Ga 3 /ρν 2 is dimensionless. For
laminar pipe ﬂow this is also proportional with the Reynolds number (18.30).
18.10 Since pressure differences p = ρ0 Q R are additive when put in series whereas Q is the same, R is

additive in series. Since the mass ﬂux Q = p/ρ0 R is additive over the branches of a parallel connection,
whereas p is the same, reciprocal resistance is additive in parallel connections.

(b) For a horizontally moving ball the Coriolis force is vertical, if the table is aligned with the ring and
vanishes if the table is orthogonal to the ring. At typical velocity of v ≈ 4 m s−1 the Coriolis acceleration
is gc = 2 v ≈ 3.6 m s−2 which is 1/3 of standard gravity. It does not make the ball deviate to the side,
but changes the vertical acceleration considerably, depending on whether the ball ﬂies along the direction
of motion of the ring or against it. (c) With the basket plate mounted orthogonally to the ring, the game is

is an expression of the form i j kl ai j kl vi v j ∇k vl with suitable coefﬁcients ai j kl satisfying ai j kl = a j ikl .
Varying the velocity and again dropping boundary terms we get (suppressing the integral as well as the
sums over repeated indices)
δ(ai j kl vi v j ∇k vl ) = 2ai j kl δvi v j ∇k vl + ai j kl vi v j ∇k δvl
= 2ai j kl δvi v j ∇k vl − 2ai j kl δvl v j ∇k vi

In order for this to reproduce the desired result δvi v j ∇ j vi we must have
ai j kl − al j ki = 1 δil δkj

where the surface terms in the integral have been dropped (assuming either p = 0 or n · ∇ p = 0 on the
surface). This vanishes only for arbitrary variations when the Poisson equation is fulﬁlled. Choosing
δ p = (∇ 2 p − s)

(21.A3)

will make δ negative and thus make the ﬁeld converge towards the desired solution.

The shear stress σx y = η(∇x v y + ∇ y vx ) belongs to the 11-grid.

The wave contains a single wave packet with a Gaussian envelope of width ∼ 1/ k with the centre

25.2 For the river bore mass conservation takes the form
U (h − h) = (U − U )h .

(25.A2)

This demonstrates that the amount of water ﬂowing in the front itself equals the amount of water ﬂowing in
the bore.
Similarly for a reﬂection bore we have
(U − U )h = U (h − h).

(25.A3)

This demonstrates that the amount of water ﬂowing towards the wall equals the amount of water ﬂowing
away from it in the front.

the given values one gets P = 37 kW which is 50% of the engine power. The computed take off time is

30.1 The total internal energy contained in an inﬁnite column of material along x with area A in the
yz-plane is,

√
T (x, t) d x = ρ0 c0 AaT0 π .

As expected, its value is independent of time.

30.4 The temperature does not depend on x (or z) because of symmetry so that Fourier’s equation
becomes
d2T
=0
d y2

(30.A1)

which has the solution T = A + By. The constants A and B are determined by the boundary conditions. If
the ﬂuid moves steadily with velocity vx (y), the advective term vanishes, (v · ∇)T = 0.

which has the solution T = A + B log r . The constants A and B are determined by the boundary conditions.
If the ﬂuid moves steadily with velocity vz (r ), the advective term vanishes, (v · ∇)T = 0.

30.6 Using the notation of example 30.2.5, the temperature in the sphere is given by (30.21) and thus,
h

where k is the thermal conductivity of water. Numerically this comes to

For Pr → 0 the integrand is dominated by large values of G(s) which in turn is dominated by large values
of g(s). Since g(s) ≈ s for s → ∞ we have G(s) ≈ 1/2s 2 and thus

For Pr → ∞ the small values of G(s) dominate. Since for s → 0 we have g(s) ≈ 1/2 f (0)s 2 and

Convection

31.1 Use the Boussinesq equations for zero velocity. The buoyancy term varies in the horizontal direction,
implying that the pressure excess also has a horizontal variation. Thus, the isobars are not horizontal, which
they have to be for any hydrostatic solution in constant gravity. The balance between buoyancy and friction
forces for the heated ﬂuid between the plates may be estimated as,
U
α ρ0 g0 Ad ∼ η A,
d
where A is the plate area. Apart from numerical factors this is of the same form as (31.8).

31.3 From the y-component of (31.39b) it follows that (∇z − k 2 )v y = 0 such that v y ∝ exp(±kz). Since

k is ﬁxed by the solution of the other ﬁelds, the boundary conditions on v y cannot be fulﬁlled except for
v y = 0.

31.4 From the exact solution we have cosh µ1 ≈ sinh µ1 ≈ 90 so that to a precision of about 1% the
determinant (31.59) becomes,

Numerical minimization leads to the quoted results.

becomes

(32.A1)

This clearly destroys the universality of the Kolmogorov law because the Kolmogorov ‘constant’ becomes

ANSWERS TO PROBLEMS
32.3 From (32.24) one ﬁnds
∂(u i u j )
+ u i (v · ∇)u j + u j (v · ∇)u i
∂t
+ u i (u · ∇)v j + u j (u · ∇)vi + u i (u · ∇)u j + u j (u · ∇)u i

u i ∇ j q + u j ∇i q + ν u i ∇ 2 u j + u j ∇ 2 u i .
=−
ρ0
Rearranging this equation it becomes the desired equation (32.86), which does not close because of the
third-order ﬂuctuation moment u i u j u k occurring in the last term on the left-hand side. There is also
a problem in the terms u i ∇ j q + u j ∇i q and ∇k u i ∇k u j which is not caused by lack of closure
in the moments. Such terms can, in principle, be handled by calculating the more general moments
u i (x 1 , t)q(x 2 , t) and u i (x 1 , t)u j (x 2 , t) , and afterwards taking the limit of x 2 → x 1 .

32.4 Write

n =

(1 + δn ) and expand to ﬁrst order in the precision δn to get
δn = −

A

δn−1 .

This shows that the approximate sequence converges rapidly for

(32.A2)
A. With the given values one ﬁnds

n = 1, 33.0915, 24.5533, 25.2815, 25.2102, 25.2171, 25.2164, 25.2165, 25.2164 . . .

C.1 (a) The total mass is M = n Mmol = i Mi = i n i Mmol,i = n i ci Mmol,i . Using V = M/ρ in
(4.26) we get the result. (b) The total energy is Í = i Ui = i (1/2)ki n i RT = (1/2)kn RT .
C.2 (a) The differential of a function is
dQ =

so that A = ∂ Q/∂ T and B = ∂ Q/∂ B, then ∂ A/∂ V = ∂ B/∂ T = ∂ 2 Q/∂ V ∂ T .
(b) We have A = C V and B = n RT/V , and thus ∂ A/∂ V = 0 and ∂ B/∂ T = n R/V = 0.
