Introduction

Throughout this presentation I have chosen to use a symbolic matrix notation. This choice
was not made lightly. I am a strong advocate of index notation, when appropriate. For
example, index notation greatly simpliﬁes the presentation and manipulation of diﬀerential
geometry. As a rule-of-thumb, if your work is going to primarily involve diﬀerentiation
with respect to the spatial coordinates, then index notation is almost surely the appropriate
choice.
In the present case, however, I will be manipulating large systems of equations in which
the matrix calculus is relatively simply while the matrix algebra and matrix arithmetic is
messy and more involved. Thus, I have chosen to use symbolic notation.

Notation and Nomenclature

Deﬁnition 1 Let aij ∈ R, i = 1, 2, . . . , m, j = 1, 2, . . . , n. Then the ordered rectangular
array

is said to be a real matrix of dimension m × n.
When writing a matrix I will occasionally write down its typical element as well as its
dimension. Thus,
A = [aij ] ,
i = 1, 2, . . . , m; j = 1, 2, . . . , n,
(2)
denotes a matrix with m rows and n columns, whose typical element is aij . Note, the ﬁrst
subscript locates the row in which the typical element lies while the second subscript locates
the column. For example, ajk denotes the element lying in the jth row and kth column of
the matrix A.
Deﬁnition 2 A vector is a matrix with only one column. Thus, all vectors are inherently
column vectors.
Convention 1
Multi-column matrices are denoted by boldface uppercase letters: for example, A, B, X.
Vectors (single-column matrices) are denoted by boldfaced lowercase letters: for example,
a, b, x. I will attempt to use letters from the beginning of the alphabet to designate known
matrices, and letters from the end of the alphabet for unknown or variable matrices.

Convention 2
When it is useful to explicitly attach the matrix dimensions to the symbolic notation, I will
use an underscript. For example, A , indicates a known, multi-column matrix with m rows
m×n

and n columns.
A superscript T denotes the matrix transpose operation; for example, AT denotes the
transpose of A. Similarly, if A has an inverse it will be denoted by A−1 . The determinant
of A will be denoted by either |A| or det(A). Similarly, the rank of a matrix A is denoted by
rank(A). An identity matrix will be denoted by I, and 0 will denote a null matrix.

Matrix Multiplication

Deﬁnition 3 Let A be m × n, and B be n × p, and let the product AB be
C = AB

(3)

then C is a m × p matrix, with element (i, j) given by
n

cij =

(4)

aik bkj
k=1

for all i = 1, 2, . . . , m,

j = 1, 2, . . . , p.

Proposition 1 Let A be m × n, and x be n × 1, then the typical element of the product
z = Ax

(5)

is given by
n

(6)

aik xk

zi =
k=1

for all i = 1, 2, . . . , m. Similarly, let y be m × 1, then the typical element of the product
zT = yT A

(7)

is given by
n

zi =

aki yk

(8)

k=1

for all i = 1, 2, . . . , n. Finally, the scalar resulting from the product
α = yT Ax

(9)

is given by
m

α=

ajk yj xk

Proposition 2 Let A be m × n, and B be n × p, and let the product AB be

CT = BT AT

Proposition 3 Let A and B be n × n and invertible matrices. Let the product AB be given
by
C = AB
(16)
then
C−1 = B−1 A−1

(17)

CB−1 A−1 = ABB−1 A−1 = I

Proof:

Partioned Matrices

Frequently, I will ﬁnd it convenient to deal with partitioned matrices 1 . Such a representation,
and the manipulation of this representation, are two of the relative advantages of the symbolic
matrix notation.
Deﬁnition 4 Let A be m × n and write
A=

B C
D E

(19)

where B is m1 ×n1 , E is m2 ×n2 , C is m1 ×n2 , D is m2 ×n1 , m1 +m2 = m, and n1 +n2 = n.
The above is said to be a partition of the matrix A.

A11 A12

A=

so that A11 is a nonsingular matrix of order m1 , A22 is a nonsingular matrix of order m2 ,
and m1 + m2 = m. Then

Matrix Diﬀerentiation

In the following discussion I will diﬀerentiate matrix quantities with respect to the elements
of the referenced matrices. Although no new concept is required to carry out such operations,
the element-by-element calculations involve cumbersome manipulations and, thus, it is useful
to derive the necessary results and have them readily available 2 .

where y is an m-element vector, and x is an n-element

will denote the m × n matrix of ﬁrst-order partial derivatives of the transformation from x
to y. Such a matrix is called the Jacobian matrix of the transformation ψ().

Notice that if x is actually a scalar in Convention 3 then the resulting Jacobian matrix is a m × 1 matrix; that is, a single column (a vector). On the other hand, if y is actually a scalar in Convention 3 then the resulting Jacobian matrix is a 1 × n matrix; that is, a single row (the transpose of a vector).  
[ Note that the commonly used definition of the gradient is the transpose of the Jacobian defined here ]

Proposition 5 Let
y = Ax
