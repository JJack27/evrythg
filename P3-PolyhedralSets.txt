3. Extreme Points, Extreme Directions, and Polyhedral Sets
Problem 3.1 
[ _to('140521094923') ]
a) Show that both standard forms are equivalent, i.e., show that each polyhedral set in primal
standard form can be written as a polyhedron in dual standard form and vice versa.
Transform the following polyhedral sets into primal and dual standard form:
(i) S1 = {x ∈ Rn : Ax = 0},
(ii) S2 = {x ∈ Rn : Ax ≤ 0, x ≥ 0},
(iii) S3 = {x ∈ Rn : A1 x = b1 , A2 x ≥ b2 , c1 ≤ x ≤ c2 }.
Problem 3.2 Extreme Points and Edges of Polyhedral Sets
Consider the polyhedron S = {x ∈ R4 : Ax = b, x ≥ 0} with A = [ 1 2 1 0 ] and b = [ 2 ].
0 1 1 1
Find the extreme point xEP corresponding to x1 = 0 and x4 = 0.
b) Find all directions of edges at xEP leading to further extreme points and determine those
extreme points.
Find the remaining extreme points.
Problem 3.3 Extreme Points of Polyhedral Sets in Dual Standard Form
Consider the polyhedra S = {x ∈ Rn : Ax ≤ b} and T = {[ x ] ∈ Rn+m : Ax + s = b, s ≥ 0},
where A ∈ Rm×n and b ∈ Rm .
a) What are the necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for x ∈ Rn to be an extreme point of S?
State a necessary condition on the dimensions and the rank of A for the existence of an extreme
point of S.
b) Show that for any extreme point x ∈ S there is an extreme point [ x ] ∈ T for some s ≥ 0.
How many elements of s must be zero at least?

c) Let A = [ 1 −1 ] and b = [ 1 ]. Determine the extreme points of T . Which of these extreme
points correspond to an extreme point of the polyhedron S?
d) Let A = 1 1 and b = 1 . Does S have any extreme points? How many extreme points
does T have? How many extreme points does the polyhedron in primal standard form (cf. Problem 3.1) that corresponds to S have?
