[ _to('140521091831') ]

An initial basic feasible solution (a feasible 0 1 1 1 vector that can be decomposed into basic and nonbasic variables such that B −1 exists) is given
by x(1) = [ 3 0 0 2 ]T with basic and nonbasic variable indices IB = {1, 4} and IN = {2, 3}, respectively.
a) Compute the vector cT B −1 N − cT . Is x(1) already the optimizer of the linear program? If
not, determine the index j ∈ {1, . . . , n − m} that yields the largest entry in this vector.
b) Determine the direction of the edge corresponding to this index j, the resulting extreme point
x(2) as well as the index sets IB and IN associated with this extreme point.
Repeat a) and b) until the simplex algorithm terminates.
Problem 4.2 Simplex Method – Degeneracy
Consider the linear program (4.1) again, where A = [ 1 2 1 0 ] , b = [ 2 ], and c = [ −1 4 1 0 ]T . An
initial basic feasible solution is x(1) = [ 0 0 2 0 ]T .
a) Why is the extreme point x(1) a degenerate vertex? Determine all possible basis index sets
IB and the corresponding nonbasic index sets IN for x(1) .
b) Let IB = {2, 3} and IN = {1, 4}. Compute the vector cT B −1 N − cT . If x(1) is not the
optimizer, determine the index j of the nonbasic variable that yields the largest entry in this vector.
c) Determine the direction of the edge that corresponds to this index j and the resulting extreme
point x(2) . What happens? Specify the new basis index sets IB and IN .
Continue the simplex method based on the result in c) until it terminates.
