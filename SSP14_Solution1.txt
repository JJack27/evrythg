Solution
Problem 1.1 Affine Transformation of Gaussian Random Variables
a)
The random variable y is generated using the linear transformation (as b = 0)
of x = [x1 , x2 ]T . Therefore, it follows that y ∼ N(µy , Cy ). For x, we have x ∼ N(0, I2 ). The mean
vector µy of y is given as
and the covariance matrix Cy of y is given as
Cy = E (y − µy )(y − µy )T = E yy T
= E (Bx)(Bx)T = BCx BT = BBT

b) As z is generated from x using the linear transformation z = BDx, we have
and
Cz = E (z − µz )(z − µz )T = E zz T
= E (B Dx)(B Dx)T = BDCx DT BT = BBT
D is a rotation matrix and therefore orthonormal, i.e., D−1 = DT . Multiplying with D leads to
a rotation of the coordinate system. As the contour lines of the PDF of x are circles around the
origin, a multiplication with D does not change the PDF. Thus, y and z have the same PDF.
For contour lines we have
fx (x) =
exp − (x − µx )T C−1 (x − µx ) = k.

Deﬁning k(c) :=
(det(2πCx ))1/2
the contour lines fx (x) = k(c) are determined by
which is a quadratic form that describes an ellipse with center µx . The principle axes are given
by the eigenvectors vx,i of C−1 . The intersection point of the contour line fx (x) = k(c) with i-the
principle axis is given at a distance of c/λi from µx , where λi is the i-th eigenvalue of C−1 .
The eigenvalues of C−1 are λ1 = 1 and λ2 = 1/2. The corresponding eigenvectors are given as
vx,1 = [1, 0]T and vx,2 = [0, 1]T . The contour line fx (x) = k(1) is shown in Figure 1.1.
For y = Bx, using sub-problem b) we compute
and
It remains to determine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of
The roots of the characteristic polynomial det C−1 − λI2 = 0 are the eigenvalues
and λ2 =
The corresponding (unscaled) eigenvectors are given as
and vy ,2 =
The contour line fy (y) = j(1), where j(c) is deﬁned analogously to k(c), is shown in Figure 1.2.
d) Determine the conditional PDF of y1 given y2 = a.
y is partioned into y = [y1 y2 ]T with µy = [µy1 µy2 ]T = [1 4]T and
The conditional PDF of the random variable y1 |y2 = a is determined by the conditional mean
µy1 |y2 =a = µy1 + σ21 y2 (σ22 )−1 (a − µy2 )
= 1 − 3 (a − 4)

and the conditional variance
σ21 |y2 = σ21 − σ21 y2 (σ22 )−1 σ21 y2
= 9 − (−3 − 3)
Finally, we have that (y1 |y2 = a) ∼ N(5 − a, 6), which diﬀers from the marginal PDF of y1 as y1
and y2 are not independent.

Some remarks on Gaussian random vectors, where we assume that all covariance matrices have full rank:

[ _to('140517113010') ]


• A vector x of independent Gaussian random variables xi is jointly Gaussian.
• A jointly Gaussian PDF of x implies that all marginal PDFs are Gaussian (choose a = e j ),
however it is important to note that marginal Gaussian distributions for each component xi do
not imply that x is jointly Gaussian. A counterexample: consider the jointly Gaussian random
vector x ∼ N(0, I) with the PDF fx (x) and random vector y with the PDF
fy (y) is constructed by multiplying fx (y) by two in the ﬁrst and third quadrant and setting it to 0 in the second and fourth quadrant. Obviously, the PDF of y is not Gaussian. However, the
marginal distributions of y1 and y2 are Gaussian as, for example,
due to the symmetry of fx (y).

• Any non-empty subset J of a jointly Gaussian random vector x is jointly Gaussian (choose appropriate selection matrix A and b = 0).
