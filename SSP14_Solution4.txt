Problem 4.1

Variance of a Gaussian Random Variable

a) In case some prior knowledge on the random parameter θ is available, this knowledge can be
used for designing an improved estimator. In case of the Bayes estimator, the prior knowledge is
given by a prior probability density function fθ (θ) of the parameter θ. An uniformly minimumvariance unbiased estimator (UMVUE) is an estimator T that is unbiased and has the lowest possible
variance for unbiased estimation. This means, that we have
Var [T ] ≤ Var [S] ,
where S is any other unbiased estimator, for all θ ∈ Θ. In case unbiased estimators with minimum
variance can not be found for all θ ∈ Θ, an UMVUE is not available. In this case, a reasonable
approach is to search for an estimator that minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) over the
value range of the parameter which is possible if a probability density is assigned to θ. The
conditional mean estimator minimizes the MSE, where expectation is taken with respect to fxθ (x, θ).
However, we assume that θ is an realization of the random variable θ drawn from fθ (θ)
which is not necessarily the true PDF. The conditional mean estimator is in general only MSE
optimal with respect to the assumed prior PDF fθ (θ) and not an UMVUE. If the assumed prior PDF
differs significantly from the true PDF of θ, this may have an impact on the performance of the
estimator.
b)

Bayes’ rule for the posterior PDF fθ|x1 ,...,xN (θ|x1 , . . . , xN ) is given as
(N)
πθ|x
(θ) := fθ|x1 ,...,xN (θ|x1 , . . . , xN ) =

fx1 ,...,xN |θ (x1 , . . . , xN ) fθ (θ)
Θ

fx1 ,...,xN ,ξ (x1 , . . . , xN , ξ)dξ

,

where we denote the posterior PDF by π(N)
(θ) for notational convenience.
θ|x
c) As fx1 ,...,xN |θ (x1 , . . . , xN ) is a Gaussian PDF, fθ (θ) is the PDF of a Gamma distribution, and the
denominator is for normalization, we have that

The conditional mean estimator is a convex combination of the ML estimator θˆML and the mean
of the prior PDF mθ . Therefore, θˆCM is in between mθ and θˆML . In case σ2θ 0 and an increasing
number of observations we belief more in the ML estimate θˆML and less in the prior mθ . In case
σ2θ = 0, the prior is correct and the estimate is mθ independent of the number of iterations N.
Contrary, in case σ2θ
σ2x|θ , the prior contains so much uncertainty that the ML estimate θˆML is
used. Given either a large number of observations N, a small conditional variance σ2x|θ , or a large
variance σ2θ of the a prior distribution of θ, it is recommended to rely on the ML estimator, since
lim θˆCM = lim θˆCM = lim θˆCM = θˆML .

However, given either a small number of observations N, a large conditional variance σ2x|θ of
observations, or a small variance σ2θ of the a prior distribution of θ, we better rely on the mean of
the prior distribution, since
lim θˆCM = lim θˆCM = lim θˆCM = mθ .

Gaussian Transmission Model

a) In order to formulate the conditional posterior PDF fθ|x (θ|x), let
z=

x
θ

=

Hθ + n
θ

=

H M×L I M×M
I L×L 0L×M

θ
.
n

As θ and n are independent and Gaussian, z is Gaussian as well. The posterior density fθ|x (θ|x) is
again Gaussian, see provided hint, with expected value
Eθ|x [θ|x] = E θ + Cθx C−1
x (x − E [x])
and covariance matrix
Cθ|x = Cθ − Cθx C−1
x Cxθ .
From the transmission model, we have that
E [x] = E Hθ + n = Hµθ ,
Cθx = E (θ − µθ )(x − E [x])T = E (θ − µθ )(H(θ − µθ ) + n)T
= E (θ − µθ )(θ − µθ )T HT = Cθ HT = CTxθ ,

Cx = E (x − Hµθ )(x − Hµθ )T

= E (H(θ − µθ ) + n)(H(θ − µθ ) + n)T

= H E (θ − µθ )(θ − µθ )T HT + Cn = HCθ HT + Cn .
From this we obtain the conditional mean
Eθ|x [θ|x] = µθ + Cθ HT (HCθ HT + Cn )−1 (x − Hµθ )
and the covariance matrix
Cθ|x = Cθ − Cθ HT (HCθ HT + Cn )−1 HCθ
of the Gaussian posterior PDF.
b)

The conditional mean estimator is given as the mean of the posterior PDF. Thus, we have
θˆ CM = Eθ|x [θ|x] = µθ + Cθ HT (HCθ HT + Cn )−1 (x − Hµθ ).

c) We consider x = y + n with the random mean y = Hθ, where θ ∼ N(µθ , Cθ ). The prior PDF
of the random mean y is y ∼ N(µy , Cy ) with µy = Hµθ and Cy = HCθ HT . y and x are jointly
Gaussian and for the posterior PDF of y given x we need
E [x] = E [y + n] = µy ,
Cyx = E (y − µy )(x − E [x])T = E (y − µy )((y − µy ) + n)T

Cx = Cy + Cn .
