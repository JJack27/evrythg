Problem 1.1

Afﬁne Transformation of Gaussian Random Variables

Two random variables y1 and y2 are generated from independent normal distributed random variables
x1 ∼ N (0, 1) and x2 ∼ N (0, 1) by
y1 = x1 − 2x2
y2 = x1 + x2 .
a)

Determine the probability density function (PDF) of the random variable y = [y1 , y2 ]T .

b)

The random variable z is generated from x by z = BDx, where
B=

,

D=

cos α sin α
− sin α cos α

,

and α ∈ [0, 2π[ is a ﬁxed and given angle. Determine the PDF of the random variable z and compare
it to the PDF of y .
In the following, let x1 ∼ N (3, 1) and x2 ∼ N (1, 2).
c)

Draw contour lines of the PDFs of x and y = Bx.

d) Determine the conditional PDF of y1 given y2 = a.
