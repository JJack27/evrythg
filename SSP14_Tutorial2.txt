2. Maximum Likelihood Estimation
Problem 2.1
Maximum Likelihood Estimation
A known signal (respectively a signal sequence) s is sent over a two transmission lines with constant
gains h1 and h2 . The transmission gains h1 and h2 shall be estimated from the observed receive
signals x1 and x2 . The observation of the i-th transmission line is disturbed by additive Gaussian
noise ni , i.e.,
∼ N(0, C) with
c11 c12
c21 c22
and ci, j = Cov ni , n j .
a) What is the underlying statistical model? State the likelihood function and determine the ML
estimator hML for h = [h1 , h2 ]T if only one observation is available.
In the following N observations are available.
If the random variables n(1) , . . . , n(N) are uncorrelated, what is the ML estimator hML for h?
c) Although N observations are available, only the ﬁrst observation is used to design an estimator
h = x(1) /s(1) . Is the estimator unbiased? Is it consistent?
If the random variables n(1) , . . . , n(N) are correlated, what is the ML estimator hML for h?
In the following, the channel gains h1 and h2 are known and the random variables n(1) , . . . , n(N) are
uncorrelated. The unknown covariance matrix C shall be estimated.
e) What is the ML estimator CML for the noise covariance matrix C?
Hint:
_v('140503090632') [ derivatives of trac and determinant ]
The ML estimator CML is consistent, but is it unbiased as well?
