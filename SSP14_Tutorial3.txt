(N)
is the Fisher information IF (θ) and serves as a metric for the information on θ contained in the N
statistics x (1) , . . . , x (N) . If the estimator is unbiased, the inverse of the Fisher information gives the
Cram´ r–Rao bound (CRB) on the variance of the estimator ˆ (1) , . . . , x (N) ).

θ(x

a) Assuming that L(x (1) , . . . , x (N) ; θ) satisﬁes the regularity conditions, show that N i.i.d. statistics
x (1) , . . . , x (N) carry N times as much information about θ as one statistic x (1) . This means that for N
i.i.d. statistics
(N)
(1)
IF (θ) = NIF (θ),
(i)
where IF (θ) is the Fisher information of i statistics.

b) Consider N i.i.d. statistics x (1) , . . . , x (N) , where x (i) is
1) uniformly distributed on the interval [0, θ] with unknown θ ∈ (0, ∞), i.e., x (i) ∼ U(0, θ),
2) Gaussian with unknown mean θ ∈ (−∞, ∞) and known variance σ2 , i.e., x (i) ∼ N(θ, σ2 ),
3) binomially distributed with unknown success probability θ ∈ (0, 1) and known number of trials
K, i.e., x (i) ∼ B(K, θ).
Determine, if applicable, the CRB and the Fisher information for an unbiased estimation of the
parameter θ using N i.i.d. statistics x (1) , . . . , x (N) for each distribution. Justify your answer.

As the noise vectors n(1) , . . . , n(N) are assumed to be i.i.d. with n(i) ∼ N(0, C = σ2 I M ), the
statistics x (1) , . . . , x (N) are independent and Gaussian. In addition, the regularity conditions on

Advanced: Multivariate Estimation II

θ(x) ∈ R M based on one statistic x with
A parameter θ ∈ R M is estimated by an unbiased estimator ˆ
the PDF fx (x; θ). The covariance matrix of the estimator ˆ
θ(x) is given as
Cˆ = E ˆ − E ˆ

In the following, assume that L(x; θ) satisﬁes the regularity conditions (cf. problem 3.1). Then, the
score function
∂
∂
g (x; θ) =
(x; θ) =
log (L(x; θ))
∂θ
∂θ
can be used in order to obtain the CRB on Cˆ .
θ
a) Let t(x, θ) be a function of x and θ. Show that
E g (x; θ)t (x, θ) =
T

Hint: Start with

∂ E[ t T (x,θ)]
∂θ

∂ E t T (x, θ)

∂t T (x, θ)
.

and use the deﬁnition of the score function g (x; θ).

θ(x) be an unbiased estimator for θ. Use the result from sub-problem a) to
b) Let t(x, θ) = ˆ
determine E g (x; θ)ˆT (x) . Note that ˆ
θ
θ(x) is not a function of θ.
c)

Show that E [g (x; θ)] = 0.

d) The covariance matrix of the score function is called Fisher information matrix IF (θ). Let
t(x, θ) = g (x; θ) and determine IF (θ) using the results from a) and c).
e) Now consider the random variables u = aT ˆ
θ(x), a ∈ R M and v = bT g (x; θ), b ∈ R M . Starting
with
Cov [u, v ]
ρu,v = √
≤ 1,
Var [u] Var [v ]
show that
Var ˆm (x) ≥ (IF (θ))−1

.

f) The eﬃciency of an estimator is deﬁned as the ratio of the least possible variance and the
actual variance. It can be shown that, under certain conditions (cf. chapter 4.6) and assuming i.i.d.
statistics x (1) , . . . , x (N) , every ML estimator is asymptotically unbiased, i.e.,
ˆ
lim E θML (x (1) , . . . , x (N) ) = θ,

N→∞

and asymptotically eﬃcient, i.e.,
√
ˆ
N θML (x (1) , . . . , x (N) ) − θ

N→∞

∼ N 0, IF (θ)

.

Why does not every practical implementation of an estimator use the ML principle?
