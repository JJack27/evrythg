Problem 5.1
LMMSE Estimator, MSE and SNR
Consider a MIMO point-to-point channel where the transmitter is equipped with NT transmit
antennas and the receiver is equipped with NR receive antennas. Using the linear MIMO model and
assuming additive white Gaussian noise v ∈ RNR with v ∼ N(0, σ2 I), the receive signal y ∈ RNR at
the receiver can be expressed as
y = Hx + v ,
where x ∈ RNT with x ∼ N(0, Cx ) denotes the transmit signal and H ∈ RNT ×NR denotes the channel
matrix. In the following, assume that H is known to the transmitter and the receiver.
a) Derive the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimator for an estimation of the
transmit signal x based on the receive signal y . Why is the LMMSE estimator the minimum mean
square error (MMSE) estimator as well?
Hint: Following derivatives may be helpful:
∂tr {X A}
= AT ,
∂X
∂tr X AXT
= X AT + X A.
In the following, we consider a SIMO channel, i.e., we have NT = 1.
b) Determine the ﬁlter which maximizes the receive SNR. Which SNR does this ﬁlter achieve?
c) Show that in this case the LMMSE estimator actually is a matched ﬁlter, i.e., a ﬁlter that
maximizes the signal to noise power ratio as well.
Hint: Given the matrix A ∈ Rn×n and the vectors b ∈ Rn×1 and c ∈ Rn×1 , it follows that
A + bcT
−1
= A−1 −
A−1 bcT A−1
1 + cT A−1 b
d) Express the MSE achieved by LMMSE estimator as a function of the optimal SNR.

SLMMSE with xLMMSE = SLMMSE y .
c) Determine the error covariance matrix and the covariance matrix of the estimates for both
LMMSE estimators. What do you observe?
d) Let z ∼ N(µz , Cz ). Show that in this case T LMMSE and SLMMSE are minimum mean square error
(MMSE) estimators as well.
Problem 5.3
Least Squares MIMO Channel Estimation
Consider a transmitter which is equipped with NT transmit antennas and a receiver which is equipped
with NR receive antennas. In order to estimate the channel between transmitter and receiver, the
transmitter transmits N globally known training symbols {xi }i=1 ∈ RNT . The corresponding receive
signals at the receiver are given by N vectors {yi }i=1 ∈ R . The channel between transmitter and
receiver is constant during the transmission of the N training symbols.
a) Formulate a linear model Y LLS = XT LLS ∈ RN×NR in order to determine the linear least squares
(LLS) estimator T LLS : RNT → RNR , x → yLLS = T T x.
b) State the orthogonality condition for the estimator T LLS . What is the span of the subspace of
the errors Y − Y LLS and what is the span of the subspace of the estimates Y LLS ?
c) Using the result from sub-problem b), determine the linear least squares estimator T LLS and the
least squares estimate Y LLS .
For those who can’t get enough of optimization problems:
d) Determine T LLS without exploiting the orthogonality principle.
