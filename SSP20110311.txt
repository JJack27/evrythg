You may use a simple pocket calculator to solve the numerical problems. Duration of the exam is 90 min.
1. Describe the Whitening Approach in the context of linear models (Sketch, CRLB and derivation
of the estimator θ).
(20 Points)
2. A random variable X characterised by its PDF fX (x) is mapped onto a new random variable Y
by means of a transformation
Y = −2 · (X − 3)2 .
Derive the resultant PDF fY (y).
(10 Points)
3. Explain the terms eﬃcient estimator, unbiased estimator, minimum variance estimator, and asymptotically unbiased estimator using appropriate sketches. Give an example estimator for each category.
(15 Points)
4. Explain the concept of a Matched Filter (Sketch, Interpretation, Application). When and how is
it used?
(15 Points)
5. A binary detection problem is modelled by
where the noise samples w[n] are iid N (0, σ 2 ) and s[n] = 12. Sketch the resultant PDFs and
clearly visualise the threshold, critical regions, and regions of detection errors.
Assuming further that the signal s[n] is changed to s[n] = 2δ[n] + 3δ[n − 1] − 5δ[n − 2] and σ = 1,
derive a test statistic and an expression for the optimal detection threshold given PF A .
(20 Points)
6. Given a signal model
where w[n] are iid N (0, σ ). Derive the CRLB for a linear estimator of the unknown parameter
θ. Further, derive the Maximum Likelihood estimator (MLE) θM LE for the unknown parameter
θ assuming the availability of sample sets of size N > 1.
Assuming that the unknown parameter is known to be uniformly distributed within the range of
θ ∈ [π, 2π], derive the Maximum A-Posteriori estimator (MAP) θM AP for the unknown parameter.
