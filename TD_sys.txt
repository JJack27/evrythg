Sampling of a continuous signal
Discrete-time signal
Discrete-time models describe relationships between sampled variables
x(kTs ), u(kTs ), y(kTs ), k = 0, 1, . . .
The value x(kTs ) is kept constant during the sampling interval [kTs , (k + 1)Ts )
A discrete-time signal can either represent the sampling of a continuous-time
signal, or be an intrinsically discrete signal
Discrete-time signals are at the basis of digital controllers (as well as of digital
filters in signal processing)

Discrete-time linear system
y(k)
Cx(k) + Du(k)
Given the initial condition x(0) and the input sequence u(k), k ∈ , it is
possible to predict the entire sequence of states x(k) and outputs y(k), ∀k ∈
The state x(0) summarizes all the past history of the system
The dimension n of the state x(k) ∈ n is called the order of the system
The system is called proper (or strictly causal) if D = 0

Stability of discrete-time linear systems
Equilibrium
Consider the discrete-time nonlinear system
f (x(k), u(k))
g(x(k), u(k))
Definition
A state xr ∈ n and an input ur ∈ m are an equilibrium pair if for
initial condition x(0) = xr and constant input u(k) ≡ ur , ∀k ∈ ,
the state remains constant: x(k) ≡ xr , ∀k ∈
Equivalent definition: (xr , ur ) is an equilibrium pair if f (xr , ur ) = xr
xr is called equilibrium state, ur equilibrium input
The definition generalizes to time-varying discrete-time nonlinear systems
15 / 32
Stability
Consider the nonlinear system
f (x(k), ur )
g(x(k), ur )
and let xr an equilibrium state, f (xr , ur ) = xr
The equilibrium state xr is stable if for each initial conditions x(0) “close
enough” to xr , the corresponding trajectory x(k) remains near xr for all k ∈
Analytic definition: ∀ε > 0 ∃δ > 0 : x(0) − xr < δ ⇒ x(k) − xr < ε, ∀k ∈
The equilibrium point xr is called asymptotically stable if it is stable and
x(k) → xr for k → ∞
Otherwise, the equilibrium point xr is called unstable
16 / 32
Stability of first-order linear systems
Consider the first-order linear system
x(k + 1) = ax(k) + bu(k)
xr = 0, ur = 0 is an equilibrium pair
For u(k) ≡ 0, ∀k = 0, 1, . . ., the solution is
x(k) = ak x0
The origin xr = 0 is
unstable if |a| > 1
stable if |a| ≤ 1
asymptotically stable if |a| < 1

###Stability of discrete-time linear systems
Since the natural response of $x(k + 1) = A x(k) + B u(k)$ is $x(k) = A^k x_0$, the stability properties depend only on $A$. We can therefore talk about system stability of a discrete-time linear system $(A, B, C, D)$
Theorem:
![()](140604093411.png)
The stability properties of a discrete-time linear system only depend on the modulus of the eigenvalues of matrix A  
[ the modulus means the absolute value / magnitude of a complex number ]

The natural response is x(k) = Ak x0

Take any eigenvalue λ = ρejθ :
|λk | = ρ k |ejkθ | = ρ k
A is always diagonalizable if algebraic multiplicity - geometric multiplicity
If A is not diagonalizable, it can be transformed to Jordan form. In this case the natural
response x(t) contains modes kj λk , j = 0, 1, . . . , alg. multiplicity = geom. multiplicity

Zero eigenvalues
Modes λi =0 determine finite-time convergence to zero.
This has no continuous-time counterpart, where instead all converging
modes tend to zero in infinite time (eλi t )

Natural response: A3 x(0) = 0 for all x(0) ∈

For u(k) ≡ 0, the buffer deploys after at most 3 steps !

Sampling continuous-time systems
Exact sampling
Consider the continuos-time system
 ˙x(t) =
y(t) =
Ax(t) + Bu(t)
Cx(t) + Du(t)
We want to characterize the value of x(t), y(t) at the time instants
t = 0, Ts , 2Ts , . . . , kTs , . . ., under the assumption that the input u(t) is
constant during each sampling interval (zero-order hold, ZOH)
u(t), u(kTs)
¯(k), kTs ≤ t < (k + 1)Ts
u(t) = u
¯x(k) x(kTs ) and ¯y(k) y(kTs ) are the state
and the output samples at the kth sampling
instant, respectively
26 / 32
Let us evaluate the response of the continuous-time system between time
t0 = kTs and t = (k + 1)Ts from the initial condition x(t0 ) = x(kTs ) using
Lagrange formula:
(k+1)Ts
x(t) = eA(t−t0 ) x(t0 )+
eA(t−σ) Bu(σ)dσ = eA((k+1)Ts −kTs ) x(kTs )+
eA((k+1)Ts −σ) Bu(σ)dσ
¯(k), kTs ≤ σ < (k + 1)Ts .
Since the input u(t) is piecewise constant, u(σ) ≡ u
By setting τ = σ − kTs we get
eA(Ts −τ) dτ
x((k + 1)Ts ) = eATs x(kTs ) +
Bu(kTs )
and hence
¯x(k + 1) = e
¯x(k) +
¯(k) !
which is a linear difference relation between ¯x(k) and u

The discrete-time system
¯x(k + 1)
¯y(k)
¯ x(k) + B¯
¯ u(k)
¯ x(k) + D¯
depends on the original continuous-time system through the relations
eATs ,
¯ provides the exact evolution of state

Leonhard Paul Euler
(1707-1783)
For nonlinear systems ˙x(t) = f (x(t), u(t)):
¯x(k + 1) = ¯x(k) + Ts f (¯x(k), u
¯(k))
For linear systems ˙x(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t):
x((k + 1)Ts ) = (I + Ts A)x(kTs ) + Ts Bu(kTs )

Note that eTs A = I + Ts A + . . . + n! + . . .
Therefore when Ts is small Euler’s method and exact sampling are similar
