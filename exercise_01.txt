Equation 2.4 (from the SB textbook, online 2nd edition) is a key update rule we will use throughout
the course. This exercise will give you a better hands-on feel for how it works. There are 0.6 points
for plotting each of the ﬁrst four graphs, 0.3 points for plotting each of the second four graphs, and
0.2 points for answering each speciﬁc subquestion (everything ending with a question mark).
Do all the plots in this question by hand. You should not even need a calculator, as the numbers are easy to place by eye. You will get a better feel for it if you place the points manually. To
make it easy for you, It’ll include some graphing area and a start on the ﬁrst plot here, so you should
just be able to print these pages out and draw on them.

Task 1 (1.2 pts.) Suppose the target is 1.0 for six steps, then 0 for six steps, and then alternates between 1.0 and 0 for six more steps, as shown by the grey line in the graph below. Suppose the initial estimate is 0, and that the step-size (in the equation) is 0.5. Your job is to apply Equation 2.4 iteratively to determine the estimates for time steps 1-18. Plot them on the graph below, using
a blue pen, connecting the estimate points by a blue line. The ﬁrst two estimate points are already
marked and connected in dark blue (or black) below:

What is the estimate after 6 updating steps? (give a symbolic expression, not number)
What would it be after 10 steps, if the target continued to be 1? (give a symbolic expression,
After 20 steps? (give a symbolic expression, not number)

Which step size produces estimates of smaller error when the target is alternating?
Task 4 (1 pts.)
Repeat with a step size of 1/(t-1) (i.e., the first step size you will use is 1, the second is 1/2, the third is
1/3, etc.).

Based on all of these graphs, why is the 1/(t-1) step size appealing?

Why is the 1/(t-1) step size not always the right choice?
