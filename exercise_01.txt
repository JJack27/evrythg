Equation 2.4 (from the SB textbook, online 2nd edition) is a key update rule we will use throughout
the course. This exercise will give you a better hands-on feel for how it works. There are 0.6 points
for plotting each of the ﬁrst four graphs, 0.3 points for plotting each of the second four graphs, and
0.2 points for answering each speciﬁc subquestion (everything ending with a question mark).
Do all the plots in this question by hand. You should not even need a calculator, as the numbers are easy to place by eye. You will get a better feel for it if you place the points manually. To
make it easy for you, It’ll include some graphing area and a start on the ﬁrst plot here, so you should
just be able to print these pages out and draw on them.
