Task
Model the dynamic behavior of a rigid body characterized in an environment partly filled with water.

Model description:
Represent the body as $B = \left(m, \mathcal{G}, z\right)$ with mass $m$, geometry $\mathcal{G}$ and position $z$. 
Due to gravity $B$ is subject to a total force $F(z)$.  

Implementation:
Assume that the dynamics can be described by studying a collection $\mathcal{C}$, $|\mathcal{C}| = N$ of particles $p_i \in \mathcal{C}$, $p_i = \left(\rho_i, V_i, z_i\right)$ with mass densities $\rho_i$, Volumes $V_i$ and positions $z_i$ subject to the constraints:
$$\sum\limits_i^N \rho_i V_i = m$$
$$\frac{\partial z_i - z_j}{\partial t} = 0 \; \forall p_i, p_j \in \mathcal{C}$$
$$\sum\limits_i^N F(z_i) = F(z)$$
