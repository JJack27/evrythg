Notes on the derivative formula at t = 0
The formula L(f ) = sF (s) − f (0− ) must be interpreted very carefully when f has a discontinuity at t = 0. We’ll give two examples of the correct interpretation.
First, suppose that f is the constant 1, and has no discontinuity at t = 0. In other words,
f is the constant function with value 1. Then we have f = 0, and f (0− ) = 1 (since there is
no jump in f at t = 0). Now let’s apply the derivative formula above. We have F (s) = 1/s,
so the formula reads
L(f ) = 0 = sF (s) − 1
which is correct.
Now, let’s suppose that g is a unit step function, i.e., g(t) = 1 for t > 0, and g(0) = 0.
In contrast to f above, g has a jump at t = 0. In this case, g = δ, and g(0− ) = 0. Now let’s
apply the derivative formula above. We have G(s) = 1/s (exactly the same as F !), so the
formula reads
L(g ) = 1 = sG(s) − 0
which again is correct.
In these two examples the functions f and g are the same except at t = 0, so they have
the same Laplace transform. In the ﬁrst case, f has no jump at t = 0, while in the second
case g does. As a result, f has no impulsive term at t = 0, whereas g does. As long as you
keep track of whether your function has, or doesn’t have, a jump at t = 0, and apply the
formula consistently, everything will work out.
