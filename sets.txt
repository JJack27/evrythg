(θ ∈ R)
θ = 1.2
θ=1
θ = 0.6
θ=0
θ = −0.2
aﬃne set: contains the line through any two distinct points in the set
example: solution set of linear equations {x | Ax = b}

linear equations)

Operations that preserve convexity
practical methods for establishing convexity of a set C
1. apply deﬁnition
x1, x2 ∈ C,
0≤θ≤1
θx1 + (1 − θ)x2 ∈ C
2. show that C is obtained from simple convex sets (hyperplanes,
halfspaces, norm balls, . . . ) by operations that preserve convexity

perspective function

Aﬃne function
suppose f : Rn → Rm is aﬃne (f (x) = Ax + b with A ∈ Rm×n, b ∈ Rm)
• the image of a convex set under f is convex
S ⊆ Rn convex
f (S) = {f (x) | x ∈ S} convex
• the inverse image f −1(C) of a convex set under f is convex
C ⊆ Rm convex
f −1(C) = {x ∈ Rn | f (x) ∈ C} convex
examples

• solution set of linear matrix inequality {x | x1A1 + · · · + xmAm

Perspective and linear-fractional function
perspective function P : Rn+1 → Rn:
P (x, t) = x/t,
dom P = {(x, t) | t > 0}
images and inverse images of convex sets under perspective are convex
linear-fractional function f : Rn → Rm:
Ax + b
f (x) = T
dom f = {x | cT x + d > 0}
images and inverse images of convex sets under linear-fractional functions
are convex

Generalized inequalities
a convex cone K ⊆ Rn is a proper cone if
• K is closed (contains its boundary)
• K is solid (has nonempty interior)
• K is pointed (contains no line)
examples
• nonnegative orthant K = Rn = {x ∈ Rn | xi ≥ 0, i = 1, . . . , n}
• positive semideﬁnite cone K = Sn
• nonnegative polynomials on [0, 1]:
K = {x ∈ Rn | x1 + x2t + x3t2 + · · · + xntn−1 ≥ 0 for t ∈ [0, 1]}

generalized inequality deﬁned by a proper cone K:
y − x ∈ int K
examples
• componentwise inequality (K = Rn )
xi ≤ yi ,
i = 1, . . . , n
• matrix inequality (K = Sn )
Y − X positive semideﬁnite
these two types are so common that we drop the subscript in
properties: many properties of
Convex sets
are similar to ≤ on R, e.g.,

Minimum and minimal elements
is not in general a linear ordering : we can have x
y and y
x ∈ S is the minimum element of S with respect to
example (K = R2 )
x1 is the minimum element of S1
x2 is a minimal element of S2

Separating hyperplane theorem
if C and D are nonempty disjoint convex sets, there exist a = 0, b s.t.
aT x ≤ b for x ∈ C,
aT x ≥ b for x ∈ D
aT x ≥ b
aT x ≤ b
the hyperplane {x | aT x = b} separates C and D
strict separation requires additional assumptions (e.g., C is closed, D is a
singleton)

Supporting hyperplane theorem
supporting hyperplane to set C at boundary point x0:
{x | aT x = aT x0}
where a = 0 and aT x ≤ aT x0 for all x ∈ C
supporting hyperplane theorem: if C is convex, then there exists a
supporting hyperplane at every boundary point of C

Dual cones and generalized inequalities
dual cone of a cone K:
K ∗ = {y | y T x ≥ 0 for all x ∈ K}
examples
• K = {(x, t) | x
≤ t}: K ∗ = {(x, t) | x
• K = {(x, t) | x
≤ t}: K ∗ = {(x, t) | x
ﬁrst three examples are self-dual cones
dual cones of proper cones are proper, hence deﬁne generalized inequalities:

Minimum and minimal elements via dual inequalities
minimum element w.r.t.
x is minimum element of S iﬀ for all
λ ≻K ∗ 0, x is the unique minimizer
of λT z over S
minimal element w.r.t.
• if x minimizes λT z over S for some λ ≻K ∗ 0, then x is minimal
• if x is a minimal element of a convex set S, then there exists a nonzero
λ K ∗ 0 such that x minimizes λT z over S

• production set P : resource vectors x for all possible production methods
• eﬃcient (Pareto optimal) methods correspond to resource vectors x
that are minimal w.r.t. Rn
