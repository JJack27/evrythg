Stepper Motor
Implement stepper motor model

The Stepper Motor (STM) block implements a generic model that represents tw o most popular families of stepper motors:
Variable-reluctance stepper motors
Permanent-magnet or hybrid stepper motors
The Stepper Motor model consists of electrical and mechanical sections. The electrical section is represented by an
equivalent circuit, configuration of w hich depends on the motor type. The equivalent circuits have been built w ith the
supposition that the magnetic circuit is linear (no saturation) and the mutual inductance betw een phases is negligible. The
mechanical section is represented by a state-space model based on inertia moment and viscous friction coefficient.
For a variable-reluctance stepper motor, the equivalent circuit for one phase is show n in the follow ing figure.
In this model, Ra and La(θ) represent respectively the resistance and the inductance of phase A w inding. The w inding
inductance varies as a function of the rotor position:
La(θ) = L0 + L1cos(Nr θ),
w here L0 is the average inductance, L1 is the maximum inductance variation and Nr is the rotor teeth number.
Note that at the reference position (θ = 0), the rotor tooth is fully aligned w ith A-axis pole so that the A-phase w inding
inductance is then maximum.
The total electromagnetic torque produced by the motor is the sum of the torques produced by the motor phases:
w here m is the phase number, i x is the w inding current in phase x and Lx is the inductance function of phase x w inding.
For a permanent-magnet (PM) or hybrid stepper motor, the equivalent circuit for one phase is show n in the follow ing
figure.
In this model, Ra and La represent respectively the resistance and inductance of A-phase w inding. Due to the large value
of the air gap introduced by the magnets, the w inding inductance of the permanent-magnet or hybrid stepper motor can
be considered to be independent of the rotor position. The voltage source ea(θ) represents the motor back EMF
(electromotive force) w hich is a sinusoidal function of the rotor position:
w here p is the number of pole pairs and ψm is the motor maximum magnetic flux.
Note that at the reference position (θ = 0), the North pole on the rotor is fully aligned w ith A-axis pole so that the A-phase
back EMF is then zero.
The electromagnetic torque produced by a tw o-phase PM or hybrid stepper motor is equal to the sum of the torque
resulting from the interaction of the phase currents and magnetic fluxes created by the magnets and the detent torque,
w hich results from the saliency of the rotor:
Te = –pψmi asin(pθ) – pψmi bsin(pθ – π/2) – Tdmsin(2pθ).

How to Get Stepper Motor Parameters
The parameters used in the stepper model are usually obtained from the manufacturer data sheets. In the case w here
the parameters are not available, they can be determined from experimental measurements.
Variable-Reluctance Stepper Motor Parameters
The parameters provided by manufacturer data sheets are usually: number of phases, holding torque, step angle,
voltage per phase, current per phase, w inding resistance (Ra), maximum inductance (Lmax), average inductance (L0), and
rotor inertia (J).
Permanent-Magnet/Hybrid Stepper Motor Parameters
voltage per phase, current per phase, w inding resistance (Ra), w inding inductance (La), and rotor inertia (J).
The maximum detent torque (Tdm) is not alw ays specified. This parameter can be assumed to be equal to 1-10% of the
maximum holding torque.
The maximum flux linkage (ψm) is not alw ays specified. This parameter can be obtained experimentally by driving the
motor to a constant speed N (rpm) and by measuring the maximum open-circuit w inding voltage Em (V).
The parameter ψm is then computed by the follow ing relation:
ψm = (30/pπ)(Em/N),
w here p is the number of pole pairs given by p = 360 / (2m·step). Here m = phase number, step = step angle in degrees.
Example
The p w r s e p r o o example illustrates the operation of a stepper motor drive using a tw o-phase hybrid
oe_tpemtr
stepper motor model.
The motor phases are fed by tw o H-bridge MOSFET PWM converters connected to a 28 V DC voltage source. The motor
phase currents are independently controlled by tw o hysteresis-based controllers w hich generate the MOSFET drive
signals by comparing the measured currents w ith their references. Square-w ave current references are generated
using the current amplitude and the step frequency parameters specified in the dialog w indow . The movement of the
stepper drive is controlled by the STEP and DIR signals received from external sources.
The follow ing w aveforms are obtained from a simulation of 0.25 sec operation of the stepper motor drive during w hich
the stepper rotates during 0.1 sec in the positive direction, stops for 0.05 sec, rotates in the reverse direction for 0.05
sec and stops.
Detailed w aveforms are show n in the follow ing figure.
