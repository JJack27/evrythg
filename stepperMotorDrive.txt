Description
This example presents a stepper motor drive using the Hybrid Tw o-Phase model selected among the options on the
dialog w indow . The motors parameters are those of a small stepper motor (size 23). The motor phases are fed by tw o
H-bridge MOSFET PWM converters. The DC bus is represent by a 28-V DC voltage source. The motor currents are
independently regulated by tw o hysteresis-based controllers that generate the MOSFETs drive signals by comparing the
measured currents w ith their references. The ripple in the current w aveforms is controlled by the hysteresis band of the
comparators. The sw itching frequency is variable and dependent on the motor parameters.
In this example, single-phase-on excitation scheme is used because of its simplicity. Square-w ave current references
are generated using the current amplitude and the step frequency parameters specified in the dialog w indow . The
movement of the stepper drive is controlled by the STEP and DIR signals received from Signal Builder block.
Sim ulation
The current amplitude and the stepping rate are selected in the dialog mask to be 2A and 500 step/s, respectively.
The STEP signal from the Signal Builder block controls the movement of the stepper drive.

A positive value (1.0) will make the motor rotating and a zero value will stop the rotation. The DIR signal controls the rotation direction. A positive value (1.0) will impose the positive direction while a zero value will impose the reverse direction.

The stepper motor drive operation
is illustrated by the main w aveforms (voltages, currents, torque, speed and position) displayed on the Scope block. The
simulation is done using a fixed-step solver w ith a sampling time of 1 us, providing acceptable accuracy for the PWM. If a
high PWM accuracy is required, a smaller time step can be used but the simulation w ill be slow er.
